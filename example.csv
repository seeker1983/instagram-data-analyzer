Thank you so much to everyone who has reached out sending love and prayers. I am so grateful. I’ve loved connecting with SOOO many other women who are currently going through something similar or who have been where I am, some with even more invasive and emotional treatments. I can’t even tell you how comforting it is to feel understood, supported and know I’m not alone. It’s something that’s completely out of my control and the hardest part has been trying explain to Isla Rose why there’s still an empty bedroom with a crib in it and why she doesn’t have a baby yet. Now the waiting game begins. Thank you again for all your kind and encouraging messages. 🙏🏼💛 #werereadyforyoubaby #iui #secondaryinfertility;werereadyforyoubaby,iui,secondaryinfertility;;;36979;891

I set my alarm for an hour before I knew my babies would wake so I could get my workout in. It was killer but only took me 30 minutes to complete!! Don’t over complicate setting a goal you want to achieve. Make sure it’s realistic, understand it will take time but if you stay consistent you will be successful. “The key to your success lies in your daily routine”!! One of my most asked questions is about how I established a fitness routine. After I had Jackson I got to a point that I knew I needed to get my body moving. I hadn’t worked out in years and I was feeling it mentally and physically. I wish I had a magic answer for you but getting into a routine takes mental dedication, time and consistency. How I did it... I mentally made the decision to start working out, I dragged my booty out of bed first thing in the morning and did an at home workout in my backyard. I didn’t have a mat and I think I had 3 pound hand weights. 😂 The next morning I forced myself to do it again, and again and again. It was hard at first but now I crave my workouts and if I miss a morning I can totally feel it from my energy levels. It’s my therapy. Hope this helps some of you mamas who have DM’d me about this! 💗🖤 #momfitness #carbon38 #apl #leopard;momfitness,carbon38,apl,leopard;;;18293;295

Took a pic fresh faced w/ no filter, I have the @vichyusa moisturizer on here. When I start to think about all of the daily exposure my skin has to pollutants and how quickly you can age from stress and fatigue it makes me want to be more proactive about finding products to help protect and prevent. I just discovered a new anti aging moisturizer by one of my fave skincare brands, @VichyUSA. It has a mixture of dermatologist ingredients: plant-based Peptides which are key to helping build #collagen, #VitaminC to brighten and firm, and Vichy’s Mineralizing Water to fortify and protect the skin.

Yahoo just launched a new universal email app which works with any account (i.e. I’ve imported all of my gmail accounts into the app) and it’s already making my life roughly 800 times more efficient. I’ve had the opportunity to test the app over the past several weeks and it’s honestly unlike anything I’ve seen before. It has innumerable features that organize and streamline your inbox, including automatically categorizing emails, prioritizing travel information and package tracking, offering a one-tap unsubscribe tool, summarizing deal information, providing a dedicated view of email attachments and SO MANY MORE THINGZ. Inbox chaos is over, my friends. Get excited and seriously, get the new Yahoo Mail app now. 💌 • #efficiency #workingmom #Ad;efficiency,workingmom,ad;yahoomail;;3778;72

It gets deep into pores and dissolves makeup and grime like none other, while nourishing and moisturizing your skin at the same time. Also, it smells so delicious I kind of want to spread it on a cracker, take a bite and just see what happens. 😋 Elemis has been kind enough to offer my followers a crazy great deal on this product which I just shared on instastories (spoiler: you can get one FO FREE). But, if you're reading this a day late and the stories have expired and you're overcome by FOMO, just head to elemis.com/us/mary-orton-cleansing-balm.html for the goods! 🤗 • #skincare #elemispartner;skincare,elemispartner;elemis;;1630;62

If you’re one of the latter, remain calm, no one has to know, just hit up today’s Monday Memo on memorandum.com which includes my seasonal reminder to snag an $8 pill remover on amazon so you can magically make all of last year’s sweaters look brand new. Because throwing away good sweaters due to a few measly pills is a crime punishable by death in some parts of the world.

It was my first time out of the house after suffering the miscarriage of our twins, having had surgery three days prior. Today, one year later, I’m sitting out fashion week, spending it in stained pajamas on our couch with the most delicious little angel fast asleep on my chest. It’s decidedly less glamorous, but I’m more incandescently happy than I likely deserve to be, and there’s no level of sleep deprivation nor any quantity of diaper blowouts that could keep me from marveling at this miraculous rainbow after the storm. 
Today I’m sending all my love to those who are currently consumed by this kind of heartache—many whose road to having children has been far more arduous than ours. This, too, shall pass. There’s a rainbow in store for you. ❤️ •";;;;15327;351

She is named after my maternal grandmother, Colette, and my mother, Catherine, and if she’s lucky enough to inherit even a tiny fraction of their strength, brains, grace and wit, she will be a force of nature. I’ve always dreamt of having a little girl who would take the name of these two powerful women—the two loving vessels where my story and Colette’s story began, long before we welcomed her into the world... “All the eggs a woman will ever carry form in her ovaries while she is a four-month-old fetus in the womb of her mother. This means our cellular life as en egg begins in the womb of our grandmother. Each of us spent five months in our grandmother's womb, and she in turn formed within the womb of her grandmother. We vibrate to the rhythms of our mother's blood before she herself is born, and this pulse is the thread of blood that runs all the way back through the grandmothers to the first mother.”

The photo I’m posting here is from one year ago. In the year since posting it, @trovebusiness Image Monitoring has found that it has been used illegally 3,892 times. This does not include websites or social media accounts who have reposted the image tagging, crediting and linking back to me. It reflects the number of times the image has been used without my permission on websites, in paid marketing campaigns, on product pages selling dresses, and in countless other ways. To be clear, we’re not just talking about small websites you’ve never heard of. We’re also talking about huge, global retailers and media companies (household names, which I’ll refrain from specifying) stealing this content and using it for paid marketing initiatives not only without paying the creator, but without even crediting the creator.

Image theft is a rampant problem that plagues digital creatives on social media and the web. Photography, like music, writing or any creative work product, is not free. Enormous amounts of time, resources and hard work go into the production of this content, and just because phones and computers have screenshot functionalities, does not mean the creators of this content don’t have ownership rights to their work.

Until the launch of Image Monitoring by @trovebusiness, there has been no platform or service that helps digital creatives combat the widespread theft of their work across the digital landscape. If you are an influencer, photographer or digital creative of any kind, I urge you to protect your work at protect.trovebusiness.com. 🖤 • #trovebusiness #influencerbusiness";trovebusiness,influencerbusiness;trovebusiness,trovebusiness,trovebusiness;;9526;226

So, over the years, I’ve learned how to stay prepared for all kinds of unpleasant eventualities by making sure my tote bag is always stocked with a select group of essentials.

Their products not only protect against sun damage but also repair and correct existing signs of aging that have been caused by UV exposure.

However, not everything is “picture-perfect.” We often don’t share the low points in the journey that precede the “insta-worthy” peaks.  So here’s one of mine:

Yesterday morning, I posted a video in which Rich and I pretend to be announcing a work project before I stand up and show a visible baby bump.  I also shared a blog post on memorandum.com with details on our happy news.  Finally, later in the day, I posted a photo where the growing bump is even more visible, thanking everyone for their well-wishes.

Unfortunately, some people only saw the last photo posted, and mistakenly assumed that it was an April Fool’s joke.  Since then, I’ve received hundreds of angry DMs from people who felt our “April Fool’s joke” was offensive and insensitive to women facing infertility and miscarriage.  Justin Bieber posted an April Fool’s joke faking a pregnancy yesterday and some thought we were doing the same.

To be clear, however, we weren’t joking.  I am pregnant.  The only joke was in the initial video, pretending like we were announcing a work project, when in fact we were announcing a pregnancy.

In the flood of nasty DMs that I’ve received since, one message read, “Your pregnancy joke is disgusting.  I hope you have a miscarriage someday so you know the pain that women suffer.” There were many others like it.

To those who sent these messages, your wish has already come true.  I suffered a miscarriage before this pregnancy which is why we waited until I was 20 weeks pregnant to announce.  In September, I was over 12 weeks pregnant with twins when I lost both babies, so I very much know the pain. More on this to come because we need to remove the stigma of miscarriage.

I’d simply like to remind everyone to be kind and to never “compare your behind-the-scenes to someone else’s highlight reel.” You never know what someone else has gone through.

Most importantly, I’m sending all my love to those who have experienced soul-crushing disappointment and loss on the road to having children.  You’re stronger than you think, and much brighter days lie ahead.";;;;17738;1254

Dating back to more than 4000 years, honey is one of the oldest skin-care ingredients. It’s a natural humectant, and honey also contains antioxidants, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties. And the @guerlain Abeille Royale collection has the purest honey from Ouessant black bees! I love the Abeille Royale Youth Watery Oil! Combining the strength of a serum + the richness of an oil + the freshness of a toner - this face oil is light yet powerful.

Learning and experiencing the Abeille Royale collection, Guerlain took us to Ouessant, which is 11 miles from the French coast. And it is home to a rare species of black bees. What is so incredible is that Guerlain supports the Brittany Black Bee Conservatory - which not only protects these black bees, but it also guarantees sustainable sourcing while seeking the rarest natural ingredients and best honey to formulate their products.

Mother’s Day is pure joy for some, and devastatingly bittersweet for others. On this Mother’s Day, I wish nothing but the very best this world has to offer to - all those who have mothers, those forgotten by their mothers, those whose mothers are no longer with them, and those who are working towards a healing relationship with their mothers. Wishing you endless happiness and peace today and always ❤️

This @biossance Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Mask is exceptional (there's a deluxe size Squalane + Vitamin C Rose Oil with each mask)! It smells like heaven with pure 10% vitamin C and ginseng and rose oil. Scroll to see the after picture with no face makeup on. And the reality is that my skin journey took months. And over the months, I greatly notice a decrease in redness, my skin feels and looks more hydrated and radiant, and the best part, I can wear significantly less make-up and feel significantly more confident.

We’ve been working nonstop in the last three months to build something that we’re extremely passionate about. And... it will be OPEN NEXT WEEK! We’re opening Artemis, a premier CBD shop in the West Village (87 Christopher Street). We’ve studied the endocannabinoid system and how endogenous cannabinoids and phytocannabinoids effects our bodies and minds, especially when it comes to stress, anxiety, and pain relief. I’m a huge proponent of using CBD as a way to help manage stress, anxiety, and depression. Personally being diagnosed with depression & PTSD at 15 and put on antidepressants at 20, and to this day struggle with managing the symptoms, I have a deep appreciation for CBD and how it has helped me and so many others. We’ve curated the best of the best CBD brands and can’t wait for you to experience the shop. Thank you for being on this journey with us ❤️;;;;43508;718

One battle that I’ve been dealing with for the last 19 years is a particular infection. And something changed after my brother’s wedding. When I shared my child abuse story, I got a lot of questions from women asking if I had trouble with intimacy. The answer is yes.  Emotionally, it’s always a work in progress.  Physically, it’s something that caused me years of pain. I would get a UTI every time after sex. I tried everything to prevent future infections but nothing worked. Except being on antibiotics. I was on antibiotics for 19 years (this sounds crazy but it’s true) and developed resistance to six major kinds. I saw a urologist, had countless medical exams, and they couldn’t find anything. Finally, I went to a pelvic floor therapist. On our first session, she went in and felt my pelvic floor. She said, my regular relaxed response is like someone having a fight-or-flight response. My pelvic floor was damaged and she needed to stabilize the extreme amount of tension. The pelvic floor therapy did work for a little bit, but it didn’t stop my UTIs. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When I saw my parents and my relatives at my brother’s wedding, they didn’t look larger than life as before. And in that moment, my pelvic floor DROPPED. It’s hard for me to describe, but it felt like there was a physical release and separation between my rib cage, pelvic area, and legs. It was as though, I felt that I no longer needed to tap into my fight-or-flight response. After seeing my parents, I have NOT gotten a UTI. Being on antibiotics for 19 years, I’ve been antibiotics-free for the last three months. 
I’m sharing this story, because when people think about trauma or sexual abuse survivors, they usually think about the mental and emotional pain, but not the physical manifestation of that trauma.  It’s incredible how the human body works and how it holds trauma.";;;;21259;607

I've been living it up in Puglia and enjoying my first REAL, disconnected vacation. Can you believe during the 10+ years I've been a blogger/influencer, this is the first time I full disconnected? I've kept my phone on airplane mode the entire time, except for when I needed to access a map. I needed to enjoy my vacation like one did pre-Internet. No emails, no social media; no worrying about what other people are doing. I'm trying to be present without constant worry about likes, engagement, photo and video opportunities; what photo I was going to post next, or how I was going to capture my next piece of content. I needed this break. It's been busy with projects, work, the launch of @songofstyle, and just life stuff. I think it's important we all take these moments and this time for ourselves. It's so easy to get wrapped up in an alternative universe with how connected we are today. For me, I was starting to get confused with my own voice, my point of view, my purpose. This trip has helped me pause, take a step back, reflect. I'm happy to be back, but being away was so nice! Thank you to my friends and followers who texted and DM'ed me to check in; I love you guys so much!";;songofstyle;;53635;548

For all of you who didn’t know, I use to have a clothing brand, Shop Sincerely Jules, and have recently decided to move on. There have been a lot of questions over the past year as to what happened to my clothing brand & why I closed it and I’m finally ready to address my decision. Read why, and how it made me feel over at my new account. ❤️ These were some of my fave looks wearing Sincerely Jules!

I’ve turned my shop brands’ Instagram into now my personal account, so go and follow me @juliesarinana! It’ll be more about ootd’s, things I love and all fashion. A bit more real and personable. I hope you enjoyyyy this new addition to what I’m doing! Looking forward to hearing your feedback or answering any questions! Xx";;juliesarinana,juliesarinana;;106459;742

It was absolutely devastating to watch the eye of the category 5 hurricane sit over the islands for more than 24 hours. If you have the ability to, I encourage you to help in any way you can.

I don’t think we could ever feel fully ready for it, just like any major life milestone.

To be honest, I was very (selfishly) nervous that I would lose a big part of myself when I became a mother. The ironic thing is, having June lead me to my next career step, @1212 , which is a very exciting and new chapter for me. During my pregnancy, I had lunch with a very close friend and she introduced me to the brand. I was immediately drawn to their mission and the strong, intelligent and inspiring women who created @1212 .

After I had a June, it was all I wanted to put her in. @1212 makes soft, 100% cotton apparel for babies and children. The best part? For every purchase, they donate a piece to a child in need. 
I am incredibly honored and excited to announce my role as Creative Director for @1212 today. As my job as a digital influencer will always be to share my life with the world, I’m excited to take you along for the ride!";;1212,1212,1212,1212;;9872;256

For those of you who have missed the news, Instagram is rolling out a new system where likes are no longer viewable to users. It’s already taken affect in 6 countries and Instagram says it’s intended to minimize social pressures that come with social media. Many people say that the change is a positive shift for mental health awareness. Other people argue it is a ploy to kill off the “influencer” marketing industry and increase advertising dollars to appease advertisers.

What do YOU think?

This is a very big reason why I have always and will always encourage creators to own their own platform {i.e. blogs}. I will always invest time and resources into my own website because I can control every aspect of it. 
Maybe Instagram wants to hide likes because people just aren’t “liking” anything anymore and they don’t want their platform to seem weak. 
I can sit here and lie to you saying it won’t affect me much, and that I should care about more than a “like” on Instagram. The truth is: I do care a lot about a lot more things than a “like” on this platform. However it has also enabled me to run my own business successfully for nearly 8 years. It will be interesting to see how this changes things, if at all.";;;;9877;247

This season has been a completely different experience for me, the shows and events are usually my focus. But, it’s been less about what front row I’m sitting in and what parties I’m attending and way more big picture, focused on building my business. Maybe I’m finally figuring out my purpose. Either way it feels really cool and I’m excited for the near future. Thank you @revolve and @fwrd for an awesome Paris fashion week, time to go home and keep hustling!;;revolve,fwrd;;32550;185

So you guys know I’ve always been super open about being treated with @botoxcosmetic to temporarily smooth the appearance of my moderate forehead lines. I found a specialist who I was able to speak to about looking like myself, just with fewer lines. #OwnYourLook with fewer lines with BOTOX® Cosmetic. -

BOTOX® Cosmetic is FDA approved to temporarily make moderate to severe frown lines, crow’s feet, and forehead lines look better in adults.
-
Talk to your doctor about BOTOX® Cosmetic and whether it’s right for you. There are risks with this product–the effects of BOTOX® Cosmetic may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away as difficulty swallowing speaking, breathing, eye problems or muscle weakness can be sign of a life-threatening condition. Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk. Side effects may include allergic reactions, neck and injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache. Allergic reactions can include rash, welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness. Don’t receive BOTOX® Cosmetic if there’s a skin infection. Tell your doctor your medical history, muscle or nerve conditions (including ALS/Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome), and medications, including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects.

BOTOX® Cosmetic is available by prescription only.";ad,ownyourlook;botoxcosmeticpi,botoxcosmetic;;15735;141

⁣⁣
- Put a freshly cut onion near the crib.⁣
⁣⁣
- Elevate baby’s head overnight by propping up their mattress using towels / wedge pillow, or put books under one side of the crib. (we tried this tonight and of course Nori is now sleeping upside down 😆)⁣ ⁣⁣

- Saline and / or steam from a hot shower running in the bathroom followed by Nose Frida.⁣⁣

It wasn’t until we unpacked that bag months later when I heard #%*@! from Nick, who opened the envelope to discover what might be a good portion of their life savings in cash.⁣⁣

Growing up, I remember all the odd jobs my grandparents worked as immigrants while helping look after me and my brother. They trimmed threads at a garment factory, sold veggies on the sidewalk of Philly’s Chinatown, and cleaned houses in our neighborhood. I grew up watching them devote themselves to family and saving while never spending anything on themselves. Holding this red envelope in my hand, it’s a representation of their selflessness and sacrifice. And the only way I know how to repay them, is that as parents we find a way to pass on those values to our daughter.";;;;60101;1802

I threw out all of my old makeup brushes and have gone back to some tried and true favorites from @nordstrom that I know are gentle on sensitive skin!

Right before my trip I met with author @katharinemcgee, who gave me an advanced readers copy of her new book, American Royals. Naturally, as a fan of anything royalty-related, I couldn't put it down! It's very Gossip Girl-meets-the-royal-family... so basically, my favorite guilty pleasure. While the final copy isn't yet available (out on September 3rd!), you can pre-order #AmericanRoyals now! I included a link in my InstaStories, so head there to pre-order a copy! I'm also very excited to co-host an afternoon tea with the author later this week in Dallas - stay tuned for pics... @getunderlined Pre-order is for US Residents 13+. Ends 9/2/19.

Monday is the day I get organized. I spend most of the day on my computer planning and creating content, getting my calendar organized and setting goals for the week and coming weeks. I make a point to not schedule meetings, lunches or appointments on Monday so I can have a full day of uninterrupted work - it’s so helpful for staying on track and staying focused all day!

I’ve had some of these since I lived in Houston (2011!) and still wear them consistently. They are SO comfortable and are a polished style you can wear from desk to dinner or from the plane to a long day of sightseeing! To keep them in tip top shape, I take mine to a cobbler to get resoled and cleaned every few years (highly recommend Deno’s in Highland Park Village). Each pair is handmade and fits a little differently, so I would suggest buying Chanel flats in store... with that said, you can shop some of my favorite pre-owned/discounted styles by following me in the @liketoknow.it app! http://liketk.it/2E0AQ #liketkit #LTKshoecrush #chanel #chanelflats #shoes;liketkit,ltkshoecrush,chanel,chanelflats,shoes;liketoknow;;1630;67

It took place in Minnesota, and the trip happened to coincide with Sloan’s holiday dance performance. Watching her on stage is literally one of my favorite things in the world, but I’ve learned that as a parent you sometimes have to make sacrifices for the greater well-being of your family (thankfully I was able to at least see a dress rehearsal). I got on the plane a little bit brokenhearted, but I knew the potential for this opportunity and hoped it would all be worth it. In a few days I’ll *finally* get to tell you more about it (spoiler alert – it went well!) and how it’s come to fruition over the past 10 months. I can’t wait to share more soon.;;;;9878;211

Naturally I spent far too long figuring out what I was going to read (since my accents and sound effects had to be spot on) and let's just say...we crushed it. The four and five-year-olds fully approved of our renditions (as did our beaming daughter), but the cherry on top was getting to see G, perched atop a tiny, wobbly chair, reading with such enthusiasm and conviction. I never take for granted that he's such an involved dad, but certain times in particular made me swell with pride.;;geofuller;;12395;86

I mean, I'm not ready to go back to my almost-waist-length tendrils I rocked in my early 20s, but think I'm open to a nice in-between? And 2.

Initially I was annoyed I spent time on a video I couldn’t use, but over the last few months I’ve been trying to be kinder to myself and guys, it’s worth looking into! I used to think my successes were closely tied to how hard I am on myself, but I’ve come to see that it’s not the case.

Also decided to photograph myself in Sloan's room to celebrate that it's clean for the first time this month (aside from the recent mirror art). Happy Friday!;;;;8934;103

Before you roll your eyes, hear me out. We each share three goals for the next few days that can be about anything - work, exercise, our relationship, diet, lingering projects, etc. Then we come up with three specific things we're grateful for, making sure they feel relevant and not too broad (we don’t want to forget to think about them over the next few days!). It sets the tone for a productive week, providing the framework for what really matters so that each day feels intentional and thoughtful. Feel free to share your #goalsandgratitude in the comments or just write them down for yourself so you can feel prepared to tackle the week!";goalsandgratitude;;;9408;211

I bought G a Peloton over a year ago, and while he uses it almost every day, I’ve been on it maybe 10 times. While I completely appreciate the “live your best life!!!” and “get out of the saddle!!!” mentality, I’ve come to realize it’s a littttttle too intense for me. I recently found a way to motivate myself instead of dreading it: It’s by no means revolutionary, but I put the bike on “Just Ride” mode and watch things on TV instead, namely Sex and the City (obviously season six is the best one, we probably couldn’t be friends if you don’t agree 😜). I’m coming to the end of the series (for the 50th time), so would love your suggestions for TV shows that are fun and equivalent to reading a tabloid magazine that G would have no interest in watching (aka this is *not* the time to suggest The Handmaid’s Tale). 👇;;;;8287;1469

Normally when I’m in a funk like this, I try doing everything I can to fix it, but sometimes putting all my focus on trying to solve the problem winds up being counterproductive. Instead, I decided to give myself permission to feel off without trying to find a solution, and today I wound up feeling so much more refreshed, clear-headed, and ready to tackle Monday. Just a simple reminder that we don’t all have it together all the time, even when it looks like we do on Instagram. P.S. This is what I wore to a BBQ this weekend, which I didn’t share in the moment, but honestly I was just too into the outfit to let it go unposted. 🙃;;;;9990;92

Here's a glimpse of what we bought and prepared yesterday, which should set us up through the middle of the week. Everything can mix and match together - grilled chicken can be put into salads, tacos, or eaten alongside the pesto pasta - and it definitely beats eating turkey chili five days in a row. In case you're curious, here's everything we got/made: avocados, romaine, mangos, grilled steak, cherry tomatoes, two boxes of homemade pasta from the farmers' market (added their almond pesto to one), tzatziki, feta with sundried tomatoes, grilled chicken, cucumber salad, hard boiled eggs, black beans, roasted carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli, hummus, cilantro, raspberries, almond milk, plums, watermelon, cucumbers, butter lettuce, basil, brown rice.;;;;8171;58

At first I was disappointed that Sloan was too tired to walk on her own, but feeling the weight of her body and breath on my cheek provided more comfort than I could have realized.

As it turns out, my mom was doing the same thing, albeit in a much more sentimental, gorgeous way. The day after her mom died, she melted down older pieces of my grandmother's gold and formed them into matching bracelets for herself and the three granddaughters. On the outside, the words 'Never Forget' are etched, a double meaning in the sense of my grandmother's loss and Holocaust remembrance. On the inside is the tattoo number my grandmother received at Auschwitz, which sits hidden against my own skin. An enormous part of my grandmother's identity was wrapped in the fact that she was a survivor. The number tattooed on her arm came to represent not just a dehumanizing identifier, but a signifier of everything she endured to come to America and start a family. There's no way I could ever forget my grandmother, but having a physical reminder I can look down at everyday reminds me that she's always there in some capacity. 💕;;;;19008;550

I’d genuinely love your ideas! 🙏🏻 Cuz honestly out of my three children, he might be the one I worry about the most. I never, ever want him to feel - now or in retrospect - like the time or attention he needed was overlooked, eclipsed by the needs of his sisters. The girls’ medical demands are complex and at times can feel totally pervasive- especially when their health is less than stable. And of course it would never be intentional on our part, but I worry - what will the fall out be for him? Know what I mean? 
I have to remind myself though that all I can do is PRAY and TRY. In that spirit, a couple weekends ago we went on an overnighter - just Jack and @chasewillardson and I. And it felt SO good to do something that was just for him. ☺️ Ironically he kept asking all night why Charlie and Ava weren’t with us 😂❤️ which reminded me of something else I have to remember: this little guy has a heart of gold.

I need to brag about this woman for a second. This is my mama, and to know her is to have met an actual unicorn IRL. 🦄 You guys my mom watched our kids while we were in Europe... my THREE kids... my TWO SPECIAL NEEDS children... my TEETHING BABY who did not sleep... for over 2 weeks... basically on her own (my dad ended up having to travel for work). I had several moms message me, special needs mamas especially, asking who I trusted enough to leave my girls with for that long. THIS WOMAN. That’s who. My angel mama. She raised seven children of her own (😱) and did so with a level of selfless commitment and fortitude that I am continuously in awe of and trying desperately to model in my own parenting. I am so proud and humbled to have been raised by a woman of this caliber. She is kind, faithful, diligent, driven, the hardest worker, so much fun, beautiful (I meaaaan Dang Gina), intelligent, humble, SO freaking talented, and more willing to sacrifice her own needs/wants on behalf of those she loves than anyone I’ve met. I wish every human could have a mama like @musicalgrams. How different this world might be. THANK YOU Mom for being who you are.

REAL TALK: I never even tried to breastfeed Ava. When we found out about her rare disease CDG diagnosis, I was instantly taken back to memories of all the breastfeeding issues I had with Charlie: hospital admittances due to weight loss at 4 months old, the crushing stress of constantly worrying that she wasn't eating enough & that I wasn't producing enough, losing my milk, eventual G-tube placement, etc. Because we didn't have Charlie's diagnosis yet, we didn't know then that weight gain, feeding & GI issues are all characteristic of the rare disease she has. So when Ava was also diagnosed with CDG, the thought of attempting to nurse her only to repeat those scary health issues & that overwhelming stress - well it was all too much to bare. We decided that the best thing for Ava's health was to do strictly formula so that we'd know exactly how much she was getting & could hopefully bypass the struggles that Charlie had.

Ya know what happened the second we made that decision? Mom guilt. Immediate mom guilt that I wasn't breastfeeding my baby... wasn't even going to try. Ya know what else happened? Shaming. Shaming from nurses & other parents who had no idea what our story was.

I've teamed up with @similac_us for their #PromisesProject: an initiative aimed at putting an end to parent shaming/judgment & replacing it with parent SUPPORT. Their message is that parenting has enough challenges without us challenging each other (can I get an amen?!). In the same way we promise to support our babies, we need to promise to support EACH OTHER through the differences. I've learned poignantly that parenting is not a one-size-fits-all situation. Caring for our babies should come with JOY, not judgment - especially because we rarely have any idea what someone's full story is or why they're making the decisions they're making, or what they're experiencing behind closed doors. So let's put an end to parent shaming. Join me in pledging to support other parents & put an end to parent shaming by clicking the link in my bio or swiping up in my stories. So proud of @Similac_us for this initiative. Grateful to be a part of it. #sponsored";promisesproject,sponsored;similac,similac;;4973;169

I can track this innate obsession inside of me back to a pinpoint moment in time; when I opened the December 2003 issue of Vogue Magazine to a spread photographed by Annie Leibovitz called, ‘Alice In Wonderland’.

Each image representing an iconic moments from the legendary children’s novel. Most memorable for me was the shot of Alice wearing a Nicolas Ghesquiere piece, stepping into the mirror above a fireplace.

This is an issue that is far greater than I am, but what I have humbly done is ask myself over the years, what am I doing to make my footprint a little smaller - which is something we can all do. It’s almost our habit as women to buy something new for every occasion which just perpetuates the cycle. I’m not saying to never buy anything new again but one of the things I’ve put into practice  is look to companies to rent clothes for special occasions instead of buying something new for every single event. For my sisters welcome cocktail reception, I knew I wanted something special as the MOH. @novaocto is a New York based showroom that has the most luxurious collection of dresses and gowns available to rent, including this @johannaortizofficial dress that was just perfect for the outdoor reception. Visit the showroom or shop online, they have been my go to for almost a year now for all things special events!;whatwouldjennywear;novaocto,johannaortizofficial;;10690;195

To me, wellness is a culmination of actions I take daily, through food, meditation and activity, that lead me to a place of feeling strong mentally and physically.  My life isn’t one of routine, therefore I’ve had to set practices into place that I can do anywhere in the world. My meditation mantra lately has been; “In the movement towards enlightenment, where you are is the point of arrival.” It’s my way of practicing patience and gratitude for where I am at instead of longing for what I feel I need or am missing in life. I’ve learned over the years that physical activity and movement plays a huge role in my happiness, my wellness. If I’m not finding at least 30 minutes in my day to move, be it running, flowing through a few yoga movements or making it to a Pilates class, I will feel mentally blocked. Food continues to be my biggest challenge. Eating clean is a huge priority for me, but there’s a tremendous amount of time an energy that goes into it, am I right? What have you found that helps you with your healthy eating choices? With so many people speaking about wellness I feel like it’s easy to put a ton of pressure on yourself to do it all. But what I’ve learned is that wellness is a daily commitment and state of mind. Not doing it all is more than ok. It’s about figuring out that balance inside of yourself. That’s what wellness means to me.";;;;6746;84

On a clear day, the slightest breeze is a needed relief from the Tuscan sun. I personally welcome the puffy white cotton candy clouds that clutter the skyline. I love how quickly they move, making way for the the sunlight to soak different spots, forever changing the shape of the lush landscape and always bringing something to light that hasn't been seen before. It's hypnotizing.;;;;15824;311

How it serves me. How it doesn’t serve me. I sit here writing this in a cafe looking around seeing everyone plugged in. Plugged into their computers, their phones. I’m guilty too. Everyone is so absorbed, not in each other but in their devices. There’s definitely a social shift, an awareness that this conscious attention inwards to our devices is causing a divide. A divide between reality and social reality. A divide between relationships. 
Since mid March, I’ve been writing more than I ever have in my life. The culmination of where I’m at personally combined with how I perceive the space has forced me to reflect in the form of journaling and in turn, has brought me to a far more grounded place than I’ve been in years, maybe even my life. 
I’m sharing this because I feel I’ve been distant from you guys and this is the first time I’ve been able to truly articulate this. Because every time I go to write a caption, I crave speaking of something deeper, not just captioning something for the sake of captioning. 
If I could put my finger on exactly what’s been bothering me, it would be that I’m misusing my platform. With everything that’s happening in the world around us, I feel a deep social responsibility to bring awareness to topics that can effect change. 
While sharing fashion and beauty will always be at the core of what I create , I deeply crave exploring a conversation that’s deeper than that with each of you. I’ve just been trying to figure out what that is. I’ve been a sponge lately, gravitating to things that feed my soul and bring me joy. I feel closer to being able to make that decision but I’m still not there yet. Just wanted to check in and let you know where my head has been ❤️ This photo was taken of Margo and me this weekend. Laying the grass, absorbing the sun, hair wet from the pool and not a stitch of makeup. These are the moments that mean the most to me right now.";;;;8362;281

This week, I’ve returned to my beloved Tuscany, the place where I spent every summer with my family since I was ten years old. Everything here is nostalgic to me, the crispness of the morning fog, the taste of the tomato sauce, the crunchy sugary crust of northern Italian cannolis and the warmth of being under the Tuscan sun. These are just a few of the flavors that are at the essence of the lifestyle I so fondly remember and have dreamed of returning to. I feel so fortunate that my job affords me the opportunities to make new memories and reminisce on old ones - this trip is no acception. Returning to Tuscany to celebrate @acquadiparma_official’s newest fragrance, Cipresso di Toscana has been a trip down memory lane, and now, I’ll have the most fitting fragrance to remind me not just of my childhood memories, but also the ones I’ve made just in the past few days 💕 #cipressoditoscana #blumediterraneo #acquadiparma #ad;cipressoditoscana,blumediterraneo,acquadiparma,ad;acquadiparma;acquadiparma_official;8569;185

@Olaplex Hair Perfector No. 3: There’s nothing like Olaplex! My old stylist got me hooked years ago and @beccamfreeman is a fan too… it strengthens hair from within and keeps it from breaking. I use this once a week; twice a week if my hair really needs it. It’s transformative!!

@Drybar Blonde Ale Brightening Shampoo: my favorite purple shampoo, far and away. It smells amazing, is super gentle, and prevents my hair from getting brassy.

As a person who loves clothes and colors and beautiful things but isn’t really a “fashion person,” fashion week can be rather daunting and a bit anxiety inducing. I always say the wrong thing! I always wear the wrong thing! I’m not done up enough, my body doesn’t fit into a sample size, I’m too awkward... not stylish enough... I could go on but you get the point. Also lines and small talk are just NOT MY THING. But I do love CLOTHES so that part of me enjoys the circus just a little. This year I picked three brands to see: @tanyataylor, @veronicabeard, and @rebeccaminkoff (her inclusive collab with @stitchfix 🤗). I love that each of these designers value inclusivity over exclusivity, COLOR, and pieces that inspire you to look and feel your best, like this dress. ❤️ (Walking into TT this morning was a breath of fresh air- everyone was smiling and happy and so welcoming and I’m pretty sure the happy color palette had something to do with that!!!!);;tanyataylor,tanyataylor,veronicabeard,rebeccaminkoff,stitchfix;;1258;44

The product melts into your skin immediately and it leaves the skin around my eyes looking much smoother and more hydrated.

My Flamingo razor is an essential part of my pre-dip routine - I love keeping my legs smooth and soft and shave them every other day.

•
I’ll admit when I first read about it I panicked - even if only because it served as a harsh reminder that in the business of “creating” we don’t own this platform, or our content on it.. we’re forever at the mercy of Facebook’s decisions and figuring out how best to operate around them. •
Then I stopped to imagine how my behavior/practices would change, and I realized something hugely positive. Without the pressure of visible likes, I’d probably feel more freedom to post things I wouldn’t always now - because of less fear about it being perfect and getting the MOST engagement.  As much as I try to keep it real here, of course I’m affected by the constant struggle/strive to “post what does well” - who isn’t? This is a business after all. Of course I’m always thinking of the best time to post, if my captions are engaging enough or if the photo provides enough value. (I feel like in this day and age - influencers really have to provide value to stay relevant). But when it gets to a point of paralyzing you - it’s no bueno. And perhaps if some of that pressure were relieved, I’d feel a boost of creativity which would in turn serve me positively. •
I also think this potential change is bigger than blogging - it could really improve state of mind around social media. I’m so glad that Instagram wasn’t around for my middle, high school and even early college days - as grounded a person I am I’m sure it would have negatively affected my mental health. I worry about kids growing up around us, the pressure of numbers and the social hierarchy it creates. •

•
My skin is a true combination type (I get shiny by the end of the day, but dry/flaky in cold climates) and while usually clear, I’m not free of the occasional hormonal breakout either. So for colder months (or travels) I need something hydrating that won’t clog my pores or irritate my skin. The S.O.S cream feels like butter and it’s full of clean ingredients & antioxidants - really the first “hydrating” moisturizer I’ve tried that still felt lightweight and didn’t break me out 👌🏼 Avail at @sephora. #saveyourskin #skincare #travel";saveyourskin,skincare,travel;caudalie,sephora;;1451;33

Pour ma part, depuis 2007 j'ai eu le temps de faire comme une grande experience sociale, grace à mon blog, puis Facebook, twitter et Instagram. 🤓

Mon avis ? 🙋🏻‍♀️
La critique fait mal, n'est pas forcement toujours infondée, parfois injuste, parfois utile, parfois mal formulée, elle vient souvent de personnes qui ne vous détestent pas, qui ont même souvent de l'intérêt pour vous, voire de l'affection, parfois c'est purement haineux aussi, la jalousie et l'envie de vous voir échouer! 👺
.
Après il y a Haters et Haters ! Que celui qui n'a jamais ""haté"" lui jette la premiere pierre !😇😇
.
Faute avouée à moitié pardonnée non ?
Dites moi la verité !! 🕵🏻‍♀️
.
.
🇺🇸 @diesel has launched a new campaign named #dieselHateCouture, it’s about criticism that each of us can face through social networks.
To me, since 2007, I’ve been learning a lot by major social experience from my blog, then from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

My opinion ? Criticism hurts, it’s not always unfounded, sometimes it’s unfair, sometimes helpful, sometimes poorly worded. It often comes from people who don’t hate you, they often show an interest in you, even affection but sometimes it’s purely and solely hate, jealousy and the desire to see you fail !

Well, There are Haters and Haters ! Let him who «has never hated» cast the first stone.
A fault confessed is half redressed, right ? Tell me the truth !!. .

2.Run @T3Micro Curling Iron (1.25 barrel) through the piece of hair a few times, then curl away from the face and release downward. Leave a little at the end so it will be straight (if you’d like to achieve loose beach waves like mine) #WhirlTrio

I’m thankful to receive a fresh dose of this everyday from God because I know I need it daily. Being self aware of this, I also know I need to be able to extend that same grace to others in my life (even when you think they don’t deserve it). I recently wrote out a manifesto for my new website as I use the word “Grace-Filled Living” throughout my platforms often. Here’s what it means to me: “Living in one’s true nature, seeking balance between hustle and rest, having courage, knowing that aging is a privilege, finding peace in the truth that God works His strength through our weaknesses, beauty from ashes, learning from mistakes, finding gratitude and miracles in the everyday, caring about the things that God cares about. Anything but perfection. Grace Upon Grace. A slow living movement.” #GraceFilledLiving // I hope you take a piece of that Grace for yourself this Monday ❤️ #mondayfeels;gracefilledliving,mondayfeels;;;2795;85

Your year hasn’t been a waste because you haven’t seen all of your goals come to fruition or your life doesn’t look how it “should.” Don’t “should” all over yourself (my friend always reminds me of this) 😉 Give yourself grace. Give yourself a break 🙌 and know that you can enter these last few months of the year feeling motivated (I know it makes me feel revved up) but that you also don’t have to do, be or have more to feel fulfilled. “Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order and confusion to clarity.” - Melody Beattie // Surrender to that today, not your to-do list. 👊 #howsthatformotivation #coffeeandquotes #gracefilledliving #teamjolly;howsthatformotivation,coffeeandquotes,gracefilledliving,teamjolly;;;2185;122

Working on our joint podcast @jollyeverafterpodcast ✨
Working on forgiveness & grace for others ✨
Working on becoming the people He created us to be ✨
Things that are worth it take work: your career, your relationships and your dreams. We don’t just wake up one day and have them (or the way we’d like), it takes time, mistakes, Grace and showing up everyday. It’s a choice. What are you choosing right now?

I’ll share this, while being in California so far, my joy this week has come from watching my husband @nealjolly do something he’s meant to and loves. My happiness comes from seeing him become the person God created him to be. That’s the meaning of marriage for me. I see who God is shaping him into and I couldn’t be a more proud wife right now. I’m just super content taking the backseat, watching him do his thing (because he runs a lot of the stuff you see on my channels). Just trusting all that we’re meant to do and where we’re meant to be has been the biggest lesson this year, and we’re happy right here. Not because everything is figured out or life is perfect, but because we’ve learned to be grateful for all of it. #happinesstome #teamjolly #joshuatree #1000gifts;happinesstome,teamjolly,joshuatree,1000gifts;nealjolly;;1112;41

If you want more peace, what practices do you bring into your day that promote more of it? If you want to have a better relationship with people around you, how do you create space for that? A lot of our unhappiness comes from the lack of contentment for what’s right in front of us. Gratitude is the first step and then intentionally pursuing and building into the life you feel called to creating. I share all kinds of lifestyle elements on this channel, but that’s not what makes my life whole. You don’t have to spend more or be more. This is the year of just “being.” The topics we’re gearing up to share on @jollyeverafterpodcast are going to speak to this more, but I think it’s a good time to reflect half way through 2019 and speaks into what we do, how we treat others, how we take care of ourselves, our relationships, where we spend our money, time and thoughts - what life is that creating? 💭 #slowlivingmovement #halfyearreflection;slowlivingmovement,halfyearreflection;jollyeverafterpodcast;;1509;53

In fact, I do believe we started dating immediately after that night, no games, all fireworks, hahaha💥🧀🎇😜 This was also SO not me (I love a girl who goes for it), I never asked a guy out (or would ever think to muster up the courage), but his eyes were the kindest, he had this sweet spirit and I guess mine just led me to him. Now he leads me ❤️🇨🇦 Grateful to live here, in this beautiful, diverse country & for Canada Day fireworks that give me an excuse to ask that cute guy @nealjolly out 😏🙏 #CanadaDay #teamjolly;canadaday,teamjolly;nealjolly,nealjolly;;2110;64

A lot of things had piled personally: grief, loss, frustration, disappointment and worry. Combining all of those and all the events that lead to them was hard. One at a time I feel like I can handle those feelings but all at once overwhelmed my soul in a way that felt too big for me. In all of that, I had to remind myself they’re never too big for God. I found the truths (to fight against the lies) and stuck them on sticky notes all over our condo (lol yep, hot pink ones), journaled, wrote them down in my phone and recited them over and over (these are just a few of the ways I’ve learned to fight against my negative thoughts). I’m a researcher, so it comforted me to research the evidence of why I don’t need to feel hopeless (even while I’m feeling all the other emotions, losing hope was not an option). We’re not victims of this life or our circumstances. Feelings need to be felt and they’re not meant to be pushed away, but I just didn’t want to live there forever. I want to believe that it won’t last forever, I want to believe that all of these experiences are really just preparing me to receive a huge breakthrough or blessing. I want to believe that those feelings and circumstances are necessary in order to expand, stretch and grow me into more of the person He wants me to be. Be sad, be angry but don’t lose hope (even when there’s all the evidence to make you want to) - I just believe we can always have hope. There’s all the evidence FOR it: there’s someone who fights for me, is writing my story, has a good plan and strengthens me to do all things through Him. Sometimes, I lose sight of that and it’s honestly easy to in this fallen world. It’s a constant guard I have to keep up, because the moment I let it down, I can let it take me down. The problems always seem bigger than God, but those are just lies we believe. Wait expectantly for Him to bring good out of your situation. He can do exceedingly abundantly above all we could dare to ask, think or hope ❤️ Micah 7:7 #beautyfromashes #faithoverfear #forsuchatimeasthis

She lived in our home and raised us up, and so this hits very close to my heart. This woman taught me to laugh, forgive quickly, pluck flowers from the garden, chase ice cream trucks and eat all the things - just straight up indulge 🍗 (her fave was KFC). I love being silly because of her. Truly a firecracker 💥 and never took 💩 from anyone, lol! So special and so grateful for her long life that she most definitely made the most of! Her contagious laugh and sweetness for everyone (11 grandchildren & 14 great grandchildren 😱) was such a beautiful legacy to leave behind. I hope I can end off that blessed one day.

Out of all the sports he loves, basketball is probably the only one I’ll entertain (fun to watch) 🏀 but I especially got into this series and wow. Love how sports brings people together and what this means not only for Toronto (our city we love and were born and raised in) but our country!

It’s not always convenient to answer your phone at 3am for a friend when you’ve got a big presentation the next day. It’s not always convenient to give someone grace after they’ve hurt you. It’s not always convenient to go out of your way, squeeze things in your schedule, make time for people when you have a bunch of things to do or it throws you off your routine. Hear me out. Being a 2 on the Enneagram (“the helper”) I have had to find a balance/ better boundaries because I so often would rather inconvenience myself, fall behind on work or my to-do list because I never wanted to disappoint anyone. What’s funny though (while I definitely needed better boundaries), I never looked at this as a downfall to my personality. At the end of the day, I feel productive and fulfilled knowing I showed up for people, that they knew they had me in their corner, or present in their life and checking up on them. To me, that’s the legacy I want to leave behind. I want to be remembered for being there and helping in any way I can, because we’re not meant to carry burdens by ourselves. Sometimes it’s inconvenient, but that’s the best way you can show you love people. Sometimes it’s staying later, or longer or walking through something rough and heavy with someone else when you just want to feel light and it just might require you lay down your plan. I’m not saying develop an unhealthy habit and put your priorities last, or that you shouldn’t protect your energy, I just think more of us could use a gentle nudge to look up from our to do lists and schedules and look into people’s lives you can pour into. Aren’t people what matters? It’s not inconveniencing myself to be there for people (it gives me joy), but what I mean is, it’s not always the convenient, easy thing to do when we have all these other things calling for our attention. I would just encourage you to be with your people today ❤️ I love this quote from my fave @bobgoff - “Loving people the way Jesus did means living a life filled with constant interruptions. Bring it.” #thesundaymsg #forsuchatimeasthis #esthergeneration #purposefulliving";thesundaymsg,forsuchatimeasthis,esthergeneration,purposefulliving;bobgoff;;2611;105

Whenever life gets hard we end up back in this position (except without the dress, suit and flowers). Holding hands. Heads bowed, putting our trust & hope in Him. Life isn’t always “happily ever after” - it gets messy, because people are messy. You come up against things you didn’t think would ever come your way. You get stretched and expanded more than you feel comfortable with. We were imperfect then and we’re imperfect now, but we’re going to share how we do life, handle challenges, heal, draw joy & peace, even in really hard seasons. We’ve got so much to learn (@nealjolly & I), but we’ve also had a lot of experiences that have shaped us thus far and we’re ready to start sharing them with you!

Instagram is such a quick and short snapshot of one’s life and day (usually the highlight part of it) and @nealjolly & I have been craving for a way to connect with more of you on topics and issues that are close to our hearts. Over a year ago @nealjolly came to me with the idea that we should do a podcast together and I kind of just nodded and said “maybe one day” as we had so much on our plate and I couldn’t imagine starting another new thing between our blog, YouTube and shop. While we were in Hawaii it kind of solidified to both of us that this is something we should do. I’ve really wanted to go deeper and sometimes hearing someone’s voice rather than reading their words can really help you connect. In an effort to connect with you all more, we’d love to know what are your biggest challenges or topics you’d like to hear from us? I did a mini poll on stories the other day, but hearing more in detail from YOU would be awesome!! 🧡💛💗 Before anything, your advice matters to us the most! 👇👇 I also want to highlight that May is Mental Health Awareness Month and as someone who has been open about my own (anxiety) these are the things we hope to speak life to.

In order to thrive and vibrate higher you have to let go of what no longer serves you. Grace is something I actually don’t have a hard time giving to others. I can see if people are in pain or their motive/heart behind something. Self-grace has been its own (separate and difficult) journey for me, but it’s one of the most important things you can do for yourself to have peace and live in joy (even in the chaos). If it’s grace over your relationships, mistakes, failures, body-image or mental health that you need to start having for yourself I’d encourage you to step in to that today. There is grace upon grace for you in this life, so let that wash over you 🌊🌊 Tag someone who needs to show themselves more #gracexgrace

For example (since I know you’re curious!), it groups your messages into “Views” such as deals or attachments, it controls email overload with a super easy one-tap unsubscribe box, and it puts important info like travel info to the top of your inbox.

And while doing your due diligence is great, I found one of the best places for advice was to talk to other moms. They always have the most helpful, and realistic, advice and insight. Now when my friends have their first baby, I always try to help with their registries. The last thing you need when you bring a new baby home is a bunch of clutter from unnecessary {and expensive!} baby items! One of my best friends Hanna is pregnant and we got to talking about what I think she should register for. I shared the whole list of baby must haves on mlovesm.com last Friday, and it’s on the @liketoknow.it app, too! All the items are available at @walmart too which makes it super easy!

I was thinking about how it was a splurge that’s been so worth it so I put together a post with other beauty items that I think have been worth the higher price tag.

I always loved when I incorrectly guessed an expensive outfit when it was affordable. It just goes to show that style doesn’t have to be too rough on your wallet. So now…what would you say if I said this whole outfit (ok minus the bag!) is just BARELY over $50? Crazy right?! Every style I’m wearing (so top, jeans and booties) is actually under $20! It’s bohemian and feels so perfect for this transitional summer to fall weather.

That means we’re halfway to her first birthday. Time has seriously flown by because it feels more like 3 or 4 months. It’s definitely true what they say, the time goes by even faster with a second child. I wanted to share an update for Corinna’s half birthday especially since I know some of you have babies around the same age. I posted what’s been going on in her world lately on www.mlovesm.com today! (P.S. her little seagull bubble onesie was in her @bonjourbabybaskets and I’m obsessed!

I used to be SO much better about it but I’m trying to get back into the habit because when I do make a list of my daily and weekly goals I feel so much less stressed, and I end up accomplishing more. One thing I’ve started to do recently is make a TO DO Calendar Event where I list out all the things I want to do on my Google Calendar. I basically just brain dump everything there and then rearrange so that the three most important things are up at the top. Then I can look at that during the day and chip away when I can. At the end of the day and week, I re-evaluate and create a new TO DO event for the following week. I hope that makes sense but it’s been working for me lately. What’s one of your goals for this week? One of mine is to take a bunch of clothing to donate (I’ll pretty much accept any reasonable offer on my Poshmark btw because I’m just wanting to get rid of everything. 😆 Username is @maraferreira) Anyways, cheering you all on for your goals this week!! You got this! 👊🏻😘💗 (outfit details on the @liketoknow.it app btw);;maraferreira,liketoknow;;883;37

I worked out, folded the MASSIVE pile of clothes that has been taking up space all week, cleaned out the fridge, made blueberry muffins for Augustine, and picked up a yummy nitro cold brew and a slice of cake for a date night at home tonight! It helped that Matthew took Augustine out for an adventure this morning and Corinna blessed me with a looooong nap!! 🙏 Days where you can get stuff done & treat yourself are the best!!

We were at this spot exactly a year ago (secretly with Corinna in my belly), and now here we are. I’ve always thought that time flies but never so much since becoming a parent. The changes that happen in a matter of days, weeks and years is truly incredible - exciting but also bittersweet since you know it will never be exactly how it is in this moment. In the past year so much has changed from welcoming a new baby, watching Augustine learn, explore, communicate with us more, and, of course, learn to use the potty! I can’t even fathom where the next 12 months will take us. It kind of makes me head spin and my heart hurt a little bit so I’m just going to focus on the here and now. It was a hot hot day with these two little ones but we got some fresh fruit and bread, and a surprise for Matthew! #mymotherhood #mysweetaugustine;mymotherhood,mysweetaugustine;;;739;58

This morning we went to the park and there was a brother and sister playing knight and princess in their “castle” that was really the top of the play structure. It reminded me so much of the adventures my brother and I had when we were little.

One of our favorite recent activities has been going to this park in Irvine and visiting the library across the way. Augustine loves being able to run around on the grass while I hold Corinna! I got this outdoor mat from @jjcoleusa and I love love love how easy it is to travel with. It has a quick fold design and a built-in adjustable carrying strap.

I loved having her in the bassinet but now that she’s moving around so much she needs the extra space in her crib. Of course, that presents its own problems... Corinna can roll both ways but for some reason when I put her down for naps (and in the middle of the night!) she’ll roll over and not be able to fall asleep that way. I’ll end up going in and turning her over but she’ll do it again and then continue crying. Needless to say, she’s had a few extra naps in the carrier this past week. Sticking it out though bc I know in a few weeks she’ll be onto the next thing! That phrase ""This too shall pass"" is always ringing true around here! (btw bassinet is from @aldeababy!

All I wanted to do today was sit in the sun, drink my iced coffee and just be in silence. Of course, by the time I got outside, I had less than a minute before Augustine was up. 😆Whoops!

I mentioned the method we’re doing on my Stories today and so far so good! I’ve felt a little nervous about potty training because it’s one of the first things we teach and they learn. Everything else so far {crawling, walking, first words} has been all them! As a mom, I feel a great responsibility to be their teacher and guide them in ways they’re learn and grow from. In the process though, I know I’m learning as well. I’ll definitely share the tips I’ve picked up in an upcoming blog post!

I haven’t had much time for anything and even coming up with the words to describe this week have been tough. It’s been early mornings, after being up multiple times at night, taking Ginger out with both kids, trying to get Augustine fed, remembering to eat myself, keeping Augustine busy and somewhat quiet during Corinna’s sleepy time routine, loading them + the gear in and out of the car, hiding from this heatwave, trying to fit in emails and work when both are napping, scrounging around for meals since I didn’t have a chance to go grocery shopping and just trying to make it to bedtime so I could enjoy a few glorious hours to myself before waking up to do it all over again. Phew! It’s hectic and totally crazy and yesterday I was already praying for the weekend! If you’re a busy mama of little ones, I see you.

Something about my skin makes them love me I guess! 🤷‍♀️ This summer I'm going to be using my OFF! Botanicals® Insect Repellent as a regular part of my routine. It’s plant-based* and effective so that I can enjoy spending time outdoors and not worry about getting bug bites.

He wakes up at 5am with Augustine, makes us the best breakfasts, grocery shops, changes diapers, and plays with them TRULY enjoying it. Thank you God for this wonderful man and for giving him this fatherhood role. One day Augustine and Corinna will realize just how lucky they are!

Since Matthew has sensitive skin, and we also have two kiddos, I always look for a gentle detergent. I was so excited to try the @TideLaundry Tide Free and Gentle because it’s ideal for sensitive skin, while still getting the cleaning job done. It’s also backed by the National Psoriasis Foundation and the National Eczema Association, so if you have either skin concern definitely look into it! #TideFreeAndGentle #ad;tidefreeandgentle,ad;tidelaundry;;739;82

When @mattel & @barbiestyle first approached me to be a part of their Styled By series where I style and create my own barbies I was speechless. I knew it had to represent a number of things. Representation in culture, inclusion in size, and a woman who does it all. She can have an amazing career and family, be a boss at work and at home. She can be strong yet vulnerable, assertive yet kind.⠀⠀
⠀⠀
With that said, meet the 2 Styled By Chriselle Lim dolls! An Asian boss babe and a curvy independent multi ethnic working girl- Inspired by Laura from my team! Growing up we both were never able to identify with what was out there. Whether it be skin color or body shape. That is why we are sooooo proud and honored to have this opportunity. These Barbies are more than just dolls they represent a movement towards inclusion. She is the modern woman! ⠀⠀
⠀⠀
And with that said... yes!! These dolls are available for purchase! These Styled By Chriselle Lim dolls are limited edition with limited quantity so get your hands on them now! For yourself, your best friend , your kids, nieces/nephews, & any loved ones! Make sure to snap a photo with the Barbies and use the hashtag #chrisellelimxBarbie and share your story of representation & inclusion! Will be posting on my IG!!! ⠀⠀

HAPPY SHOPPING! Link in bio! ⠀

Colette was supposed to arrive today to stay with me for the week but she literally just caught a virus yesterday, so we decided to keep her at home with my fam. I specifically picked to stay at the @1hotels Brooklyn Bridge because it is one of my favorite hotels in NY and there’s soooo many amenities for families/kids here. So much greenery, local parks, and so much room! I had all these special play dates and moments planned out for us to do here. 😢 Anyways here’s a view of my beautiful suite... I am beyond thankful to be here and have this view but it would’ve been 1000x more special with my girls here 💔 #workingmomlife #1hotelbrooklynbridge;workingmomlife,1hotelbrooklynbridge;1hotels;;8334;140

Thank you all for your all your amazing and vulnerable comments on yesterday’s photo on my realness about marriage. It has inspired me to continue to be real & raw with you guys.

Well it is. There are times when it’s f*ckin hard (especially after kids). You put your kids first and give them all you got. Then you go out there and work on your career and try to excel in that.... It’s all consuming. Then there’s YOU.. you can never lose your sense of self right? So you go out there and work on you.. squeezing in a workout, podcast, meditation, journaling, a book or whatever it is that brings inner peace & clarity. Social life? What’s that? Haven’t had one in years. I mean at this point it’s easy to let the marriage kind of “just be” because where in the world do you draw more energy and time from? It’s easier to grow individually but harder to grow  together  spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically. But maybe that’s why it’s all so damn rewarding. Moments like this.. these pure hearted moments of bliss remind you that nothing ever is really perfect & that’s ok and that anything worth having never comes easy. So for all couples out there (especially the ones with kids) find the time to be present with one another. Book that trip (without kids is highly encouraged) and if you can’t get on a boat in Venice (although that is highly recommended too 😚) then a nice dinner or staycation will do! Just a little reminder that even with relationships you gotta put in time! Check in & connect with on another. Love you @allenbrighten #chrisllen;chrisllen;allenbrighten;;36885;436

First, because amid our current 2 year struggle with infertility, we are SO aware of how special it is to have her. Second, because she is healthy and strong. Health should never be taken for granted.

Over the last several years as I have come to know the @stjude team and as I’ve had the opportunity to tour their Memphis campus (twice!) and meet parents of children who have been treated at @stjude, it is clear that what they do is *essential* and filled with love and compassion. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Compassion for their young patients, who get to enjoy childhood even as they’re facing pediatric cancer. Compassion for their families, who need support as they abruptly hit pause on their lives to pour all their energy into their child’s healthcare. Compassion for the entire world, which benefits from all of the discoveries made at St. Jude. Their research is never, ever proprietary and is openly shared with all researchers and doctors. And especially: compassion for humanity. Because back in 1962, Danny Thomas had the ‘radical’ idea to open a hospital that would treat children regardless of race, religion or ability to pay. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

I think about that often as I find myself looking down at my phone... and I always take a moment to stretch upwards like in my skating days. The neck is such a delicate area, and it’s an area that’s often forgotten.

The sweetest, most loving and loyal dog. She came with me everywhere - the kind of dog that never *needed* a leash because all she ever wanted was to be by my side. She slept with me every night cuddled up at my waist. And her tricks! She could shake hands, put her head down on her paws on command, play dead, roll over, pretend to be in time-out with her paws on the wall, leap into the air with complete faith that I would catch her...
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The last few years had been tough: in and out of vet offices, ERs, and even emergency cardiac surgery for a pacemaker. She always had a whole host of health issues but she always pulled through. And every person who cared for her would hand her back to me with words like “she is truly the sweetest dog.” I feel so lucky to have experienced this special kind of love. One as unconditional as hers. And we had an amazing 16 years together. She is so missed. Finding comfort in all the memories. ❤️❤️❤️";;;;5750;238

I personally don’t mind receiving questions like that and take no offense; in fact I think it helps start a conversation I may not otherwise initiate, and I have found it to be both helpful and healing in doing so. Learning about all of your different experiences reminds me that I’m not isolated nor am I alone in these feelings. I genuinely appreciate the sense of community that comes from it.

One of the really great points brought up was: if some *do* feel like it could be impolite to ask the question, how can we handle approaching the conversation with grace? In my case, I always prefer to share my experience first, then ask the person how she feels. It always feels more “safe” when both parties are coming from a vulnerable, open position. It’s about being in it together. ❤️ xx

My skin was gray, I had no eyelashes or eyebrows, and I was recovering from my final round of chemo.  Five years ago today I started the final stage of my treatment: a daily dose of tamoxifen.  This has meant that for the last five years, I’ve been in drug-induced menopause, struggling with the associated hot flashes, insomnia, and more (things i’m reallllllly not going to mention here, haha). But today, that entire chapter closes.  My five years on this drug is finished.  I can barely remember what life was like before my diagnosis, but...I think that’s ok.  Cancer has irrevocably changed me, but I’ve never felt stronger. I’m so thankful for these lessons I’ve learned, and mostly just feel indescribably lucky.  Not everyone makes it this far. (Swipe to see a few photos from 5 years ago...it’s CRAZY.)

It’s SUCH a great service if you’re traveling and don’t know the area, but want to get professional photos of your family or friends! They basically just help connect trailers with photographers - such a brilliant idea! ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I had an AMAZING experience and highly recommend this service! Full disclosure, these photos were #gifted but I would 100% use them again! I have a discount code (BRIGHTONKELLER50) that’s valid for $50 off for the rest of the year if you want to check out the service for yourself! ⁣⁣

Y'all, it has been a WEEK. Actually, it's been a MONTH. I probably sound like a broken record talking about the moves and the wedding and work and all the things, but it's been overwhelming.⁣

Even when it's all GOOD, GREAT, AMAZING things, it can be so easy for me to get caught up in the to-do's. To focus on what I'm stressed about instead of stopping to take a moment to reflect on how cool these life changes are.⁣
⁣
Instead of letting anxiety get the best of me yesterday, I made a conscious effort when I woke up to go slow and to be grateful. To be grateful for the million meetings beacuse at the end of the day, moving cities and marrying Duncan are such amazing things in my life, and everything WILL get done. ⁣⁣

Like even back before the engagement and I wasn't running around quite as much as I am now. Do I sound like a broken record? 😬 I know i’ve shared this before! Anyway, I thought maybe it had something to do with my food choices but I honestly have no idea at this point.⁣

Anyway, I am feeling a tiny bit better lately actually but I still don't really know the root cause of it all. I need to figure it out and I'm hoping I will - probably not until I move and get settled in Denver 🤪😬⁣

And affect me more. And get in my head, weigh me down. ⁣
⁣
Like, I can usually keep a pretty clear and rational state of mind when reading DMs and comments. I can stay “above” the opinions and stay true to me and what I’m doing. And usually stay *relatively* upbeat-ish and confident.
⁣
But I can tell when I’m getting weary. because I get weak. And sensitive. And defensive. And annoyed, easily irritated. Negative. Maybe that’s just me? But it happens every so often. It’s like my defense mechanisms get tired.⁣
⁣
I don’t know if I’m just physically tired or if I need to take a detox soon, but I kinda feel like some of those warning signs are popping up. Like i find myself wanting to send back sassy responses to people instead of taking the high road lol. Like I kinda wanna be immature and say what I really think 🤪 which I, of course, cannot and should not do! ⁣
⁣
Anyway, I had another post planned for tonight but thought I’d just share where I was instead. Sometimes it’s cathartic for me to do so.⁣
⁣
Feeling kinda tired and sensitive and you know what, THAT’S OKAY. I think the most valuable lesson I’ve learned in my 20s is the importance of self awareness and being able to admit your weaknesses and realize when you’re being a little emotional or sensitive or petty or what-have-you.⁣
⁣
Here’s to being able to admit it and it being okay. Sorry for anyone whose DM I haven’t gotten to. I try really hard. But I’m only one person and sometimes I get worn out.⁣
⁣
I am so appreciative for all of you who support me. It means more than you know 💕 thank you for building me up and cheering me on. ⁣

I’ll let y’all know what I’m selling within the next few weeks, if you’d be interested. I JUST bought some of it so I’m like 😭 about it but ALL GOOD. I might bring a bit of it, but honestly, I don’t think most of it will work.⁣

If you're hosting something for the holiday, I wanted to share few quick ways to prep for your party. And I'm not talking obvious things like buying the BBQ food or whatever! Think more items you might forget about (until it's too late) or a couple ways to make things way less stressful in general.⁣⁣
⁣
One way I like to prep for parties is to not clean the day of the party but instead do a little sprucing up the day before. A quick run over my floors is so easy to do with the @ocedarclean ProMist® MAX Microfiber Spray Mop so cleaning the day before is a no-brainer!

The couch is custom (sorry!) but the inspo wall was something I’ve always wanted to do but could never figure out. Finally, after not knowing what to do with this wall for several months, I committed! I purchased several feet of rolled-up CORK from amazon. Then hired someone to help nail the pieces to the wall to make a GIANT cork board!⁣
⁣
Then I used magazines and other sources of inspo to pull images. I also used several images from the @tezza kit too! I love how it turned out! It makes me so so happy!⁣

⁣
Follow through on a small commitment to yourself - drink water or go on a 30 minute walk⁣
⁣
Do something nice for a stranger⁣
⁣
Go out of your way to love your spouse or roommate or coworker⁣
⁣
Text someone that crosses your mind, telling them you’re thinking about them or check in on them⁣
⁣
Feed your body nutrients it needs - try to eat a healthier lunch today, making better choices bc it will make you FEEL better. More greens, less carbs (but still, personally I keep the carbs around to make the greens more bearable lol)⁣
⁣
Write down 3 things you’re grateful for - try to think outside the box and really take a moment to feel grateful for each⁣
⁣
Call someone you love or get together with them and go on a walk or grab a meal⁣
⁣
What else?! I’d love to see your suggestions! Let’s get a list going! ⁣

I beat myself up sometimes because I feel like I have to “add value” to your life with my content - either via the photo or some profound (or witty) caption. Not that I even do that very often, but still, the self-inflicted pressure is there.⁣
⁣
But then I remember, NOBODY else is worrying or thinking about this as much as I am! Literally, nobody. I’m not that important 😆🙃😉⁣
⁣
and neither are you! 😉 Meaning, nobody is thinking about you and what you’re doing as much as you are. You know?! They’re focused on themselves. Its such a good reminder I think we all need every now and then.⁣
⁣
Can you relate to this at all? Getting way too in your head about something nobody else is thinking about?! So much so that it keeps you from doing ANYTHING at all?!⁣

PS:: this photo is from my Portugal trip with @noken earlier this summer! I did a full review of their travel service and a recap of my trip on the blog if you missed it!

⁣
I get so out of sorts when I travel that I always come back and go on a MISSION to get my life together. Chaos is always a good motivator for me! 🙃🤗⁣
⁣
I decided to do a mini blog series covering how I’ve been detoxing with beauty/self-care, home, & work! Part 2 (about detoxing your home) is live on the blog if you missed it!⁣
⁣
Step one for me is the fridge and pantry! And then my bathroom - so many products I don’t use. What would be step one for you? Which part of your space feels most out of sorts?!⁣

I do not pretend to be in the Maldives, I actually worked my butt off and pitched the PR Team to get to the Maldives!

You’ve seen me sweat with no makeup, while I box and you’ve seen me in my not so glamorous outfits, while Tom and I go on hikes. Of course, you have also seen the glamorous side of blogging, colorful outfits, pool and beach pictures, but like ANY JOB, blogging has it’s not so glamorous moments and yes that means changing in the streets, your car and random bathrooms.

I think any parent with kids in school will tell you that’s September is such a hard month for so many reasons. Running around with your head cut off seams to be the theme. And fitting in a workout feels impossible  since I work in the office with our MH team while my kids are in school. I’ve decided to commit to workouts before my kids need to be out the door for school. Not ideal, but having everything ready (lunches, breakfast, uniforms out) to go before I leave for a 7am class has worked so far! I’m also so thankful that my friend Meray’s gym @rewardfitnessstudio is just around the corner and their new workout method is perfect for any busy parent ready for a good system of workouts. Sweat Sesh was AMAZING (read: killer) yesterday, feeling so good to be back in my workout routine now that crazy September has hit hard!! Anyone else feeling this way?! | Also I’m giving away a 3 month membership to help you locals get back to it too!!! Please follow @rewardfitnessstudio & @monikahibbs and leave a comment below how you’re excited to get back into ⚙️ !!! #septembermadness #fitness;septembermadness,fitness;rewardfitnessstudio,rewardfitnessstudio,monikahibbs;;1242;150

Introducing The DAWN Presest & 5 sub-presets helping you navigate with warmer or cooler light, a more saturated landscape, and helping you neutralize those bright colors and highlights to achieve a soft and romantic effect to your photos. The DAWN collection is best when using photos captured in open fields, beaches, mountain tops, wide open spaces, airy rooms and possibly a path leading to nowhere.

Love him even more after reading his post. He’s an incredible man, walking with his focus on the Lord. That really is his secret & the glue of our family.

(Although, shout out to these jeans). Iʼve started using this spray on my denim instead of washing them over and over which can cause denim to lose its shape and causes color to fade. And we DO  NOT  HAVE  TIME  FOR  THAT. Black denim needs to stay dark so this new spray helps remove odor from your otherwise clean clothes (I literally sit at my desk all day, these jeans are CLEAN, yaʼll) so you can re-wear before washing. Hereʼs to LESS washing and MORE wearing!

Don’t get me wrong I love hype and launches and all the exciting things but...I’m just not a hype girl. I thrive in planning, behind the scenes, dreaming, creating visions and executing them. I live for the behind the scenes action and then it comes time to open the curtain and I cautiously peek out from stage left. It’s not that I’m not proud; pride shoots through my veins, it’s just that I’m not great at hype. Never have been. It’s actually quite hard on this side to be your own cheerleader AND megaphone. So. What’s a shop girl to do? Well, I’m gonna put my old cheerleader skirt on and fire up the megaphone and hype as best as I can. 🗣🗣 Tomorrow we are launching the fall curated collection for the Everyday & Co shop (@shopeverydayco) and I’m BEYOND excited. We have taken things SO slow and really tried to pare down what our exact vision for the shop is and for the website. And I think we’ve nailed it. We want to find quality pieces at approachable prices for your everyday style. That’s our mission and that’s what we hope to do with our next 4 launches this fall. We are trying to do things right, which a lot of times means slowly. So we won’t be churning out collections every week like we were this spring, but instead carefully curated monthly-ish collections with limited quantities of really good pieces. And I’m excited to say that 60% of our products this time are made in the USA, and we have a few more cotton, linen and bamboo fabrics in the mix too! // Also, thanks for showing up like you do and caring like you have. It makes it a bit easier to shout from the rooftops when I know those who are listening are friends. ❤️";;shopeverydayco;;692;16

But I easily pulled together this outfit like it was no big deal and I’ve felt so cool all day 😎  just a pair of trousers and a tee and it’s a classic in my book. Do you have days like that?

Genes are a funny thing.
•
You tell me “Gem Gem” with a proud hand to your chest, letting me know you can do it now. I let you sit in a big chair even though it swallows you because I like to see how small you still are.
•
Your eyes sparkle much brighter than my own and are 3x bigger than your dads. Eyes so green, they are sometimes blue. Genes are a funny thing.
•
Your hair curls and waves on its own, a trait I beg for each morning with a curling iron as my promised guide. I twirl each curl in my fingers when you finally tire from your busy day, the only time you allow for your hair to be tamed.
•
Your animal roar surprises people when you let it out at unsuspecting times, a roar only I can identify 🦖or 🦁 May your roar always be loud + unexpected.
•
You move with your dad’s grace and my clumsiness, a combination I didn’t know could exist in such perfect harmony. Genes are a funny thing, you know?
•
You giggle in the backseat and sing to yourself, laughing, looking out the window. The world is big to you and small to me, but I hope to keep it as big as you think it is for as long as I can.
•
You let me dress you up but by afternoon your preference is diaper-only. My mom reminds me this is how I preferred to run around at your age too. Genes are a funny thing.
•
You mimic everything I do, from how I stand to what I say. It reminds me not to be perfect but careful with your little eyes and little ears.
•
You used to say “walk” to bed but now you want to be carried by dad who puts you to bed w/ no less than 5 kisses on your forehead. I like to think those counted kisses are for you, but I know they are for him as well.
•
You drop your stuff, shoes and jacket at the door. A habit well known to your parents — soul mates, kindred mess makers. We lock eyes with one another, silently saying “she’s one of us” with a smirk as I pick up your shoes, my shoes, his shoes. Genes are a funny thing.

If you looked at our house, you’d see no difference To be honest. Which means that I’m doing it right. I’m not quickly shoving things in other places unseen and calling it organized, I’m actually organizing what we use, repurposing things or giving other items away. I’m doing this for two reasons: 1) I’m a self proclaimed garbage person who loves diving into her junk piles all around her house like Scrooge McDuck at the end of a long day and 2) I don’t want to be like this anymore and I certainly don’t want Gemma to grow up in disorganized chaos thinking this is normal. Sure, I’ll level with you — mess aside our house is filled with love. If you saw our house most days, you’d know instantly it’s a home filled with love and laughter and a lot of wildness. I don’t care if Gemma drags out every toy she can find, I don’t care that she gets into the cabinets with dishes, or tosses our laundry about as I’m trying to get it put up. Those things are so very toddler centric and will pass by before I know it. The warmth of our house will never change. But the constant losing of keys, the constant misplacing of important or even everyday items, the stress of the mess — this has to change. Look, I’m not fool. A junk pile is as natural to me as a sloth hanging from a branch chewing for hours on one leaf. It’s a upheaval of my natural self and so I’m taking it nice and slow. 
This morning Bryan couldn’t find his sunglasses and I couldn’t find my wallet. It took us 5 minutes of back and forth before we finally surrendered and gave up the search. (No children were involved in this manmade delay and eventual defeat.) I used to think self care was pedicures and happy hours, now I’m seeing it’s creating a space for your soul to rest. My busyness and negligence is what caused these tangled piles and the opposite is what it takes to untangle the cords and rearrange the chaos into clarity. And hopefully, my wallet is in there. Somewhere. (This is a photo of Gemma also “helping me organize.” I pray to God her natural self is more Marie Kondo than Tornado Kendi.)";;;;1296;25

My life just functions a lot better with order and one place that I especially love to trash out is my car. Which is the WORST because I love my car and I want it to be clean but alas, I am who I am. One of the things that I notice that I do the most is just toss my purse anywhere in my car when I’m getting in (usually the backseat) and 10 out of 10 times my purse is open and flying goes all the things. I was 34 years old when I realized this mess has to stop. Well I have the cutest solution for this issue — a bag hook by @lunnaint and @swarovskiforprofessionals! I simply hook it on the headrest of my seat and it is out of the way, not on the floor and nothing falls out! Genius, I tell you. Plus it’s a really nice accessory for your car. This one is the Queen Bee, which is darling, but they have other designs and car charms too! (See my stories for other pieces you can accessorize your car with + a 15% discount code to use!) I now have two on the back of our headrests — one for me, and one for Gemma’s items! It’s not only functional but a really beautiful and stylish addition to my car.;ad;lunnaint,swarovskiforprofessionals;;1716;35

In this business I’m in (don’t make me the I word), the most successful style influencers have that ONE look that they perfect. And I watch with complete fascination and respect, as I’ve never been able to perfect that ONE style. Over the years, I’ve tried before to edit my style down to one theme, but then I find myself making a 180 turn to another look. It’s jus the way I am; I love color, I love monochrome, I love bold, I love simple. I love it all. As I was cleaning out my closet this month (yeah MONTH not just DAY, you read that right. It’s been a journey.) I was kind of frustrated at all of the things I wanted to keep — there is no real theme to it all. But as I stepped back into my closet today I realized that that’s because it’s just who I am. I’m not just one thing and as much as my brain wants to brand myself with staying within the lines of one style,  I can’t brand myself as just one thing. I hope it’s exciting for you to see the ebb and flow of my personal style and not a roller coaster — well, actually I hope it IS a roller coaster because who doesn’t love a good thrill? All that to say, I felt really good in this outfit. It was simple, easy and hell I didn’t even feel like a doucehbag in the hat. #babysteps As a brand, I might not make sense. But I’m starting to not care. My brain would love a nice and neat brand that can be packaged up tidy and perfect, but my heart says color one day and black and white the next day.  And I just can’t help it. Heart over brain every time. (Also if you are reading this thinking wow she has a lot of emotions over clothing. Have I got a blog for you...) http://liketk.it/2DP5h #liketkit @liketoknow.it";babysteps,liketkit;liketoknow;;3141;167

Nothing bad happened or anything like that but I was just kind of done with being online. I looked at Bryan and said “my brain has melted. I’m done working this week” and we decided to just do whatever this weekend. No plans, just no work. We found ourselves at our favorite Mexican restaurant, a vintage pop up market where I found a really cool piece of art, we swam, we took walks, we cuddled and snuggled and slide down our new slide and read new books we found, and y’all - it was the best. I love my job and I love being a content creator or whatever I’m supposed to be called these days but sometimes the line is so blurred between life and content that I sometimes forget to breathe. This weekend I took that big long proverbial breath and it felt so good to exhale. Here’s some probably not instagram worthy shots of our weekend (except for that first one of Gems 😍) for you to enjoy. I hope your weekend was long and happy, too. by the way,  I do feel rare and lucky to have people in my corner of the internet who are there if I post twice a day or once every other day. You get me and support me and I know this probably doesn’t make sense but it helps to know that you guys will be there even if I take a quick break. Thanks for letting me be me, even if that me is a tired human whose bad at the internet sometimes. Back to regular programming tomorrow ❤️❤️;;;;3290;45

It seems weird for a blogger to say this but I’m a v v modest person so these photos were 100% out of my comfort zone. (Thanks to my sweet photographer for always being the most zen and encouraging. Cc: @bryanskeen) I don’t really talk much about boobs and I’m really good at hiding these girls 😬 But over the last few months with being super transparent about sizing in my Try-ons YOU guys have helped me see my body in a new way! So when I got the opportunity to try out a new bra from @jockey and review them on the blog for you guys, I knew I had to say yes — bra photos and all! You’re always asking about good bras and this one is amazing — comfortable and wire-free 🙌🏻 this is a huge game changer for bigger chested ladies!

Over the years, I’ve learned that having a designated work bag gives me peace because everything essential to my work day can stay in one spot always. I’m not a naturally organized person so I’ve discovered that having a work bag that works for me (e.g. lots of pockets, compartments, plenty of room and now I’ve discovered one with device charging capabilities!) is my best option for keeping sane in an ever changing workday.
•
•
So today I’m sharing the coolest work bag on the blog with @walmart and @motileofficial! I’ve linked a few of my favorite battery-packed work bags for staying charged on the go rather it’s commuting, travel or if you’re a coffee shop hopper like me 😬 best news: everything is well priced under $100 and the quality is amazing!

I've been loving my naturally wavy hair when living in L.A., with its desert-dry climate, for over 12 years now, but last week during our family road trip to the East Coast area, I felt my hair was out of control -- frizzy, no shape, big, and messy, because of the humid weather in most of the cities we went.  So mostly I either did either a low bun or just a simple braid like this.  For people with long hair who live in the area with high humidity, normally how do you do your hair? 💁🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ #hair #gucci #summerstyle #pleatedskirt (see outfit details through the link in my profile, or here: http://liketk.it/2Dz6A );hair,gucci,summerstyle,pleatedskirt;;;6859;70

Well, first of all, I like to keep my travel make-up kit at a minimum, but with a lot of sunscreens. Secondly, I force myself always to think about water, and drink it whenever I think about it ! Oh, and I rarely bring hair tools with me during any Summer traveling -- a low/high bun is always a good idea for my big and frizzy hair. Here are some of my favorite beauty products I brought with me during our last trip(slide over to see). Most of these products I bought from @nordstrom , and most of them were recommended to me by the Nordstrom beauty department salespeople, everything from skincare to make-up, because they are one of the places I would trust, and I always like what I buy from them. 😍

Last week I was invited to take part in @sunglasshut ’s Summer Personality Quiz to determine my perfect summer shades. It is a 30 second quiz, and I was matched as a Globetrotter, among the other choices of Beach Babe, City Slicker, and  Explorer --- how fun! 🥰So, based on the results, @sunglasshut selected these 2 sunglasses for me,  as well as some fun goodies that fit my personality.  In the first picture I'm wearing @maisonvalentino , and the 2nd one is from @tiffanyandco . Would like to hear your thoughts about which pair is your favorite? 1. Valentino Red ? Or 2. Tiffany Blue?  #FaceTheSun #ad;facethesun,ad;sunglasshut,sunglasshut,maisonvalentino,tiffanyandco;;4228;107

Mañana empieza oficialmente el otoño así que es un buen momento para reflexionar. Hace un tiempo leí que todos tenemos un verano que lo cambia todo. Lo cierto es que no hay dos veranos iguales, cada uno tiene su historia, y estoy contenta porque aun con la complejidad de ciertas cosas, este quedará para el recuerdo como el verano de los síes. Sí a todas las escapadas que se han cruzado en nuestro camino. Sí a organizar tantos viajes como hemos podido. Sí a todos los planes de última hora. Sí a todo lo que implique barbacoa o espetos de sardinas. Sí a todas las reuniones familiaresque han surgido. Sí a muchos chapuzones en la piscina o en la playa. Sí a decir “no” mas veces. Sí a priorizar el ser feliz. Este verano ha sido vivido intensamente, como deberían ser todos los veranos☀️🌴❤️ Maletas/Suitcases from @away .

.
Siempre he envidiado a quien ha tenido su destino de veraneo, su pueblo, su pequeño retiro lleno de paz o de lo que sea que necesite. No he tenido costumbres en lo que a veranear se refiere. Nunca ha sido rutina ir a un sitio u otro, aunque mis padres son de diferentes pueblos, y mis abuelos han vivido en pueblos distintos. Nunca he tenido la necesidad de irme de mi sur, pero siempre he querido sentir el deseo de volver a un lugar excepcional de vez en cuando. Hasta que conocí a Salva,  y de ese primer “tenemos que ir a que conozcas Sagres”, surgió nuestra primera tradición veraniega. Aquella zona del Algarve salvaje y apartada llena de playas ausentes me conquistó. Con Olivia decidimos darle una oportunidad a la zona mas “civilizada” y fue como sin querer pero queriendo conocimos Távira. Tengo que decir que por fin he encontrado “mi sitio”, el lugar al que vuelvo, con el que sueño y deseo. Donde quiero veranear todos los veranos que me queden, porque quiero ver cómo se suceden los veranos allí, cómo crecen los míos y un día los hijos de mis hijos. Disfrutar de las tostadas con compota de higo, el aire que se respira, el ruido que no oigo porque nunca me he sentido tan en paz como en ese maravillosa lugar (hotel) pero que yo siento como la casa de un familiar lejano al que solo visitas en verano. Desde que hemos vuelto, solo pienso en lo mucho que me gustaría vivir allí y así, con mucho menos pero en un lugar donde no necesitas tanto porque lo tienes todo. Definitivamente este visje y este verano, me han cambiado para siempre🌾💛

Y este año no tengo foto cumpleañera oficial (y ya voy dos días “tarde”), pero es el verano con mas fotos bonitas de la historia y en su lugar, les he escrito una pequeña carta, que voy a seguir escribiéndoselas de vez en cuando. Seguramente muchas no digan nada, pero otras en cambio guardarán grandes recuerdos de las memorias que hoy estamos creando sin pensar. Parece mentira que ya han pasado 4 años del primero y 2 del segundo de #deun14deagostorevolucionario

Dejar de ser la que esperan que sea, dejar de ser la que quiero que mis hijos vean, dejar de ser la que marque la pauta, dejar de ser la que pienso que puedo llegar a ser. Y así, en el vaivén de las olas que me helaban los pies pero calentaban mi alma gélida, encontré sosiego. Encontré calma y algunas respuestas. Encontré la paz que tanto ansiaba, aunque de puertas para fuera no lo pareciese, porque lidiar con dos niños pequeños es de todos menos relajante. Pero lo importante es que me he dado cuenta que quiero una vida normal, con sus cansadas rutinas, quiero un ritmo que sea a ratos agotador pero siempre constante, quiero acostarme exhausta como cada noche  y levantarme igual de cansada pero entre voces que me reclaman para cosas poco importantes y alguna que otra risa. Me he dado cuenta que se necesita tan poco en esta vida para ser plenamente feliz, que no entiendo nuestra loca manía de complicarnos tanto la vida. 
Y así fue como en la lejanía del hogar, bajo aquel sol caliente con olor mar, el ruido de las olas y a veces el del viento al mecer las ramas, entre las risas que empiezan de forma inocente y acaban en lágrimas, pero también en los enfados que acaban en ataques de risa, probé de nuevo el sabor de la felicidad y descubrí que el camino a ella está donde resida la paz. 
Y si algún dia me pierdo, volveré a donde sé que comienza el camino, donde surge la primera ola, donde nace el viento, donde crece la paz.🌾

Sabéis que he heredado muchas prendas de mi madre e incluso de mi abuela! Y al igual que Olivia&Bruno han heredado ropa de cuando yo era pequeña, tengo algunas prendas que significan mucho para mi, que quiero que me acompañen durante mucho tiempo y un día sean un recuero para ellos también.

In the second one, the light was much more even, but I had just ate my body weight in chips and queso, had been schvitzing on the rooftop for the last two hours during lunch, my dress belt/tuck was messed up from sitting, and my sleeves could have been pulled down, too. Couldn’t decide which was the lesser of two evils, so here’s both of them 😜 (And don’t even ask how long it took me to decide which one to put first in the flip through. 😂🙈) But REAL TALK: If you, too, have been on a constant quest for queso dip in Chicago, you MUST GO to Lonesome Rose. All of their tacos are amazing, of course get the guac, but OH MY GOSH THE BOWL OF QUESO. So. Damn. Good. And oddly so hard to find in the city?!

These @CALIAbyCarrie Energize leggings check every box! ✔️Took them for a spin in Palm Beach a few weeks ago, and have worn them to a few fitness classes in Chicago, too — and I’ve loved them every time! #Sponsored #CALIAbyCarrie #StayThePath;sponsored,caliabycarrie,staythepath;caliabycarrie;;669;21

On the blog, you’ll find items that I purchased many moons ago and still get so much use out of because when you wash it better, you can wear it longer! I’ve teamed up with @Downy for a #30Wears Challenge, and I encourage you to do the same. Downy found that more than 40% of people wear clothing less than 10 times before throwing them away, and there’s a lot we can do to help change this! With cold and quick washing cycles, high-quality detergent, and Downy fabric conditioner (an in-rinse conditioner that I’ve been using since college, minus the few years in New York I sent out my laundry haha), you can extend the life of your clothing by up to four times. That means fewer garments purchased, worn out quickly, and sent to landfills. 👏🏼 So here’s the deal – You know I love this Cali|York Tee… I got it back in January of 2018 and I’ve worn it countless times since, but I’m committing to wearing it 30 times (!!) over the next few months and documenting the progress along the way! I’ll be sharing more on stories and showing it off here at the end of the challenge, too. So if you see me over the summer, chances are I’ll be wearing this shirt. 😂 Let’s do this!

If you’ve been reading the blog or listening to the podcast, you know that I pretty much have the opposite of the travel bug lately 🙅🏼‍♀️✈️, but I wouldn’t have missed this trip for the world. India was a complete whirlwind — three days of INCREDIBLE wedding festivities 💃🏼, seeing the Taj Mahal, the wild adventure of shopping for dresses, experiencing the insane traffic, the sensory overload, eating alllll of the amazing food, checking another country off my list... It was truly such an unforgettable week. 🇮🇳 But honestly, my top takeaways of the trip were that A) my friends are pretty effing amazing, and B) there’s a lot we can all learn from Anuj’s family! They were so welcoming, joyful, kind-hearted, loving, and just so much fun. ❤️🥰 El, you make the most stunning bride! 🤩 Can’t wait to do it all again in three months. (But, like, thank god American weddings are only one night. I promise I won’t sleep on a couch at your reception in June! 😂😴);;ellenlandgren;;2752;32

Curled up on the couch with a good book. 📖 I feel like I rarely finish books... I’m queen of reading, like, 20 at a time, which is not exactly productive. I also only read a few pages a day so that kind of slows me down, too. But I was talking with my therapist a few weeks ago about making more *non-work-related* goals and I’ve decided that one of mine this month is to finish two books. (I have two very long flights coming up so that should make it pretty easy!) I have a million books in my apartment that I need to read before I buy another, but it could be fun for anyone else looking for recommendations: What’s the best book you’ve read lately?! 📚 (PS: If you have questions about anything pictured, I’ll put a swipe up to my living room blog post in stories!) http://liketk.it/2AiF3 #liketkit #LTKhome #graymalin #societysocial #bowsapt #myoklstyle #worldmarket;liketkit,ltkhome,graymalin,societysocial,bowsapt,myoklstyle,worldmarket;;;1473;80

In a world of highlight reels and curated feeds, I think it's so important to connect on a deeper level these days. There will be a mix of solo shows, as well as conversations with some of my coolest friends and closest contacts.

I went to get my nails done tonight and was *shocked* that there was a 30 minute wait... (Normally I go on Tuesdays because it’s my salon’s slowest day.) And not to mention, it’s been snowing allllll day, so I figured I would be the only one in there. My technician reminded me that Valentine’s Day is in 2 days (tomorrow by the time you’re probably seeing this) and I was like OH! Right! Totally knew that. 🙃 So here’s a cute pic from a Valentine’s Day project from two years ago... 💕 Fun Fact: I had just fractured my ankle the week before and was in a giant walking boot but had to put on heels for this shoot 🙈 So that’s why I’m essentially sitting on the sidewalk 😂👌🏼Crushing it. http://liketk.it/2zTGg #liketkit;liketkit;;;907;28

I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to put the last four months into words... @remoteyear was so much more than I expected and everything I didn’t know I needed. I explored new-to-me parts of the world, lived in four cities I never thought I would, totally changed my perceptions of South America, had a handful the hardest days I’ve ever experienced, almost quit and flew home in Month 2, learned so much about myself in such a short amount of time, came face-to-face with a lot of my fears and insecurities, did more reflecting and journaling than ever before, learned to live with roommates again, brushed up on my Spanish, got my patience tested over and over and over again, had some of the funnest days and nights, cried more than I expected, belly laughed on a daily basis, made so many memories that I hope to never forget, but most of all — got to know 26* humans I might not have otherwise met. I wasn’t looking for a new community at all, I simply wanted to live abroad for a few months. But I found a group of people that I now can’t imagine my life without. I love you, #RYKahlo. Forever grateful for these incredible four months. 🖤 (*26 Kahlitos + all of the #RemoteYear staff and city teams along the way, too!) #JetSetJRS;rykahlo,remoteyear,jetsetjrs;remoteyear;;1663;35

I feel like I haven’t been that cold in months! The real feel was just under 50 degrees and combined with my sweaty clothes, it felt like the dead of winter, even under the teddy. (When you wear the same coat every day for four months, it basically becomes amother member of the group — Teddy 🐻) ANYWAY — It was cold AF and I got thinking about how I’m in for a ruuuude awakening when I get back to the States. 50 feels like a summer day in the winter in Chicago.

Sharing my favorite (affordable!) moisturizer that saved me so much space when packing my toiletries for South America. @Olay Luminous Whip has SPF 25, makes your skin look naturally radiant, and acts as a primer for your foundation, too. It takes the place of four different products in my skincare and makeup routines, which saves me both suitcase space and time in the AM! (Two very hot commodities in my world.)

You’ve been more than I expected in so many different ways. 🇵🇪 I meant to post this on Saturday, but that’s kind of how the month has gone... I’ve been working on the art of balance and learning to let go of a tight schedule. (My default when things feel out of my control...) We move to Colombia this coming Saturday, which means I have five more days to cross as much off of my Bucket List as I can here in Lima. In the last few years that I’ve been traveling more, accepting that I’ll never get to see and do it all has been one of the hardest lessons to learn! Instead of getting obsessive, I just try to tell myself that there’s always a next time... Before I landed in Peru, I kind of thought it would be a “one and done” kind of trip, but here I am, one month in and not quite ready to leave. And while I thought Machu Picchu & Cusco were the main places I wanted to visit from Lima, Mancora, Juarez & Laguna 69, and the Nazca Lines are on my list for next time. And although my clothing will be glad to know I’m leaving Lima (the food here is some of the best I’ve ever had... *too* good, tbh), I’m really going to miss this place. Peru, you’ll always hold a special place in my heart (where I got to start this @remoteyear adventure and meet so many new friends!) and I already can’t wait to come back! 🖤 #RYKahlo #remoteyear #jetsetJRS #sturdyabroadRY #machupicchu #peru #sacredvalley;rykahlo,remoteyear,jetsetjrs,sturdyabroadry,machupicchu,peru,sacredvalley;remoteyear;;1690;30

So many cute shops and cool restaurants, no shortage of street art and stunning murals, countless beautiful buildings covered in color, and lots of local flair. 💜🧡💛💙💚 I bought this jacket right before I left and almost didn’t pack it in fear it would take up too much room and not get enough wear, but I definitely would have had to go shopping if I hadn’t brought it along!

No glass, much lighter to toss in your bag, and so easy to serve in a cocktail or even neat! Black Box Spirits is new to Illinois with new states coming soon 🙌🏼 Cheers!

I’ll be spending one month in Lima, Peru 🇵🇪, one month in Medellín, Colombia, one month in Bogota, Colombia 🇨🇴, and one month in Mexico City 🇲🇽! ✈️ I’m on a rollercoaster of emotions as the days dwindle... I’m so so so so so so excited, I know this is just what I need, I’m anxious to meet the 25 other people I’ll be living and working with for the next few months, I’m so very sad to leave Chicago and my friends and family, I’m eager to brush up on my Spanish, and I’m so ready to get outside of my comfort zone, say yes to all the things, and see what life is going to look like for the rest of the year! Oh, and I’m scared shitless, too. 🙃 (And don’t even get me started on the stresses of packing... 😬 Send help.)

I wanted something more modern, so I went with a lob cut for a second time. The first time my hair was longer and I felt like I couldn’t manage the lob style, so I went back to my old haircut. Well after my weight loss, I felt like my hair needed a new look. This time we went a little shorter with the lob, which it perfect for the Miami heat. I read that lobs are flattering on all hair types, even my thick curly hair which you never get to see, because I flat iron my hair. I’m looking forward to styling my new hairdo! Do you have a lob haircut? Are you loving it? Also new! I was able to shoot four new looks today and this is a little sneak peak of one of the four dresses I’m featuring on the blog next week. It fits true to size.

I lost 21 pounds, went down 4 dress sizes and 3 sizes in pants. I did this by eating healthier than ever, including lots of good healthy carbs and joining a community that’s all on the same page. I have been struggling with trying to lose weight the last three years and I still can’t believe that I’m down to a size 0. To be honest, the dress size was not the goal. My goal was to feel better about myself, stop the bloating, and learn how to control my eating. My non-scale victories include, increased energy, no more bloating, and a feeling of being inspired. Speaking of feeling inspired, I think I shared more outfit photos in the month of April than I did for the entire year in 2018 and that’s a direct result of how I’m feeling from the inside, out. If you’re feeling the same way I felt before I started FWTFL, I invite you to register using my affiliate link. If you use my link I will send you an invite to my closed Facebook group where we share meal ideas and encourage each other.

Between having acne, textured skin, and asymmetrical features, I’m much more self conscious about how my face looks than my thighs or belly. I feel lucky that the body positive movement has taught me strategies to accept and love my size, and I’ve been trying to use those same concepts when it comes to my face. For example, following skin positive accounts on IG and seeing other beauties with rosacea, pimples, acne scars etc has definitely improved my own self image. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The irony is I’ve always told people not to be afraid to experiment with their personal style, not be held back by old school rules about what “flatters” their body, etc, but I still believed that I couldn’t pull off certain hair styles or beauty trends because of my face shape or skin. Recently though, I’ve been trying to let go of that toxic thinking and have FUN with beauty products. And it’s been so freeing! I’m so honored that @IPSY chose me to be a part of their campaign and is encouraging all of us to discover our unique beauty. What’s a beauty trend you currently feel like you can’t pull off? High pony tail? Short hair? Red lip? Let’s start challenging these ideas and get out of our comfort zones together ❤️💄 #DiscoverYourself #IPSYpartner";discoveryourself,ipsypartner;ipsy;;1938;108

I’ve been using @GilletteVenus razors forever, and I just tried their new Extra Smooth Sensitive razor—it left my legs feeling better than ever 🙌🏽 The secret is in the SkinElixir, a technology that creates a barrier between the blades and the skin for a more comfortable shave.

Skin acceptance is probably the part of body positivity that has taken me the longest to come to terms with. On my face, I struggle with acne, ice pick scars, texture ""issues,"" and on my body of course there's stretch marks, keratosis pilaris, hyperpigmentation, scars and more. It's hard to love skin that's not poreless and hairless when so often that's all we see. I've contributed to that too, using apps to blur imperfections. I've recently made a concerted effort to feel good about my skin, so I've started to follow accounts of people with skin like mine and it has totally helped. All of this to say: I know first-hand how much of a difference representation makes in our confidence and love what their new #MySkinMyWay campaign is doing. (Not to mention I've used their razors exclusively for the past decade and they are literally the best!) So here's my thigh, cellulite, hair, pores, scars and all.

She is always asking for me to either dance with her, cuddle her, or have a picnic with her.. all of which I am happy to do all day every day. 💓FRANKIE: she smiles with her eyes and you can’t help but do a giant smile right back - which means she is always making us really really happy. She sleeps so good and sometimes I feel like she is sleeping all day (jealous).

I know it is so cliche to say but geez how crazy are our bodies?! It’s amazing. I wanted to post these progress pictures because where I saw the most changes was when I started doing keto with my hubby. He has done the keto diet on and off for 9ish years.. ever since I met him he has done it. He feels really good when he does it so he has just continued to do it. I am the type of person that if I’m going to have a cookie I’m gonna have a few 😂 and during my pregnancy I ate pretty much what I felt like while trying to make healthy choices.. but I have a maaaajor sweet tooth. I gained 50lb with each of my pregnancies. So that has been the biggest change for me with keto is 1. Feeling so good being off carbs and sugar and 2. Seeing the most results to lose the baby weight I put on - just to feel strong and healthy. I’m super proud of my husband @davidavidavid because he has been working really hard on putting together a keto meal plan with all of our favorite recipes. He will be launching it a week from today so go follow him to see sneak peeks of the meals, insta stories of how he makes some of them, and just more things keto 💪🏻 I know it’s not for everyone but it works for us. *to answer the most common question I get - yes I’m still nursing! She drinks only breast milk - I nurse 90% of the time and the other 10% she gets breast milk from a bottle from David while I’m at work.;;davidavidavid;;100430;1201

Going to share some of my favorite brands, style evolution and why, and some of my obsessions like leopard .. if I see it in leopard I feel like I must have it.. but only the right leopard print because sometimes it’s just not right. Okay and apparently there is a difference between leopard and cheetah print which I just learned not too long ago 🤯 all my closet built ins were made and installed by @classyclosetsus 💓;;classyclosetsus;;40380;326

They will try and be new things depending on their phase of life, be parents, husbands wives, have a career, maybe be president 💁🏼‍♀️.. etc 💓 right now Atticus wants to be a fisherman, dad, and a fireman. So happy for him that he is now in Kindergarten and I can’t wait to watch him grow and learn.

I had to say goodbye to my best friend, my first baby, Maddox. Shortly after we arrived home with Poppy from the NICU Maddox got very sick and had to be rushed to the emergency vet in the middle of the night. We did everything we could to save him over the weekend. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. He waited to meet his sister, but his body was tired. He fought all he could through diabetes, Cushing disease, Evans syndrome and in the end cancer. When he was diagnosed with cancer last February the doctors told us he only had 6 months to live. Our little fighter gave us an extra year and a half. I got Maddox during my first year in college and took him everywhere with me. He was my little partner in crime. We lived in 4 different states and 8 different homes throughout his 13 years. He taught me how to be a mom. My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I have dreaded this day for a long time. 
Maddox, I love you more than all the stars and the moons. If money could have saved you, you would have lived forever. You’re gone from our lives but never from our hearts. Thank you for waiting to meet your sister. We will see you again someday. 😢🐶 #maltese #dogmom #rainbowbridge";maltese,dogmom,rainbowbridge;;;2484;345

After a long and grueling week in the hospital battling preeclampsia with dangerously high blood pressures and 72 hours of magnesium, I was finally induced Saturday. At 34 weeks, our little warrior made her debut while “How Great is our God” played softly in the background. I can’t think of a more appropriate song for our precious miracle baby. She’s already overcome so much, but her battle isn’t over quite yet. The last few months have been the most difficult challenge of my life and I promise I’ll share all the scary and emotional details soon. Right now, we are so thankful to the entire NICU staff who is helping her get stronger everyday and for everyone who has been sending prayers for Poppy. We can’t wait to bring her home. #nicumom;nicumom;;;3148;93

Happy to report that today has been a million times more manageable. My mom got into town and stopped by to provide some much needed girl talk, laughs, and some worship music in an attempt to help lower my BP. Justin had a chance to go home and spend some time with the pups and shower. Lucky! 🐶 🐶 🐶 We found out they will be inducing me on Friday so baby girl will be here this weekend!! Dreading the next round of magnesium, but at least this time I’ll get to meet our little sweet pea afterwards! 😊 #33weeks http://liketk.it/2Bojy #liketkit @liketoknow.it;33weeks,liketkit;liketoknow;;949;41

In the morning, Justin and I went in for one of our twice weekly doctor visits and BPP + growth ultrasound. Since my blood pressure has been elevated these last two months, we’ve been keeping an extra close eye on my levels. During our visit, my numbers hit a new high, reaching critical levels. When I heard the alarms sounding from the blood pressure machine, I knew I was in trouble. An hour later, I was admitted into labor and delivery triage and hooked up for monitoring. On the inside, I was fighting a mounting panic attack. Being told you have to lower your blood pressure as soon as possible while two doctors and a group of nurses take two rounds of blood work and insert a catheter is more than a little stressful. Especially for an anxiety-ridden type A personality like myself. Not too surprisingly, my blood pressure skyrocketed. Justin and I were both scared, but we kept telling each other it was in God’s hands. If our little one was meant to come today, then we had peace with it. After a few hours, a marathon of Property Brothers, and my sweet husband doing everything he could to keep me laughing and smiling, my blood pressure started to go down. Our 10-hour rollercoaster finally came to an end, and we were released to go home. I did a little victory dance in the hospital bed and immediately chugged a 48-ounce bottle of water. Guys, I was SO thirsty. They wouldn’t let me have any fluids in case they had to do an emergency c-section. I’ve never been more thirsty in my life. 😂 Once we got home, Justin got me my favorite Mexican takeout, and a giant well-earned bowl of cheese dip and I went TO TOWN. Hoping to keep baby girl in for a little longer! Thank you for the sweet messages and prayers! They really do mean the world! 😘 #32weeks #preclampsia | Dress by @shoppinkblush 💗;32weeks,preclampsia;shoppinkblush;;1214;37

I’ve always prided myself on having some pretty elevated psychic skills. It’s a well-known fact amongst family and friends, so when I started having dreams early on that we were having a little boy, we were all convinced. I was even already working on my boy themed registry!
With Christmas a few days away, we were eager to get confirmation. While at our appointment, we asked if we could find out before we left town. The lab downstairs was already closed for the day, BUT they had an old ultrasound machine in the office they were willing to trot out. Guys, it had a VHS recorder attached to it! It was dusty and squeaky, but at that moment, it was the most beautiful piece of equipment I’d ever seen. We were bursting to see our little boy. The ancient quality combined with a camera-shy little one wasn’t ideal, but after 10 minutes of searching, our doctor said she was 80% sure it was a boy. Our suspicions were right! 
When we left, I felt like something was off. For the first time, my heart was telling me something different, something new. So we decided to go to an independent ultrasound place to get confirmation the day before we left town. So there we were, bags packed, ready to hit the road with our baby boy when the ultrasound technician, with her fancy schmancy machine, asked “Are you ready? Look at the screen!” A second later the letter “B” appeared on the screen. There it was — a big ole B for our little boy. And then the letter “U” popped up. I could feel Justin’s hand squeezing mine. With our eyes glued on the screen, she continued to type...Y...P...I...N...K. 
You would have thought she typed a foreign language on the screen. I looked at Justin with my jaw on the floor. A million questions rushed through my head: What r we gonna name her? What’s she going to look like? Within seconds, she became a real person, a little human... our little girl. When we got in the car, we both had tears of joy. It felt right... It felt perfect. Our little angel in pink. (To read about my preeclampsia diagnosis, click the link in bio!) 😘";;;;1469;18

But what you may not know, is what one of my all-time favorite Valentine's Day memories is. It was the first year Justin was living in LA. I was finishing up my junior year at Auburn University and missing him terribly. After a long day of classes, I headed back to my condo, where I discovered dozens of pink gerbera daisies hanging by their stems from the porch ceiling, dangling above a throng of rose petals scattered across the floor of my porch.  I can still remember the instant feeling of butterflies. I was nervous and giddy all at the same time. At the end of the flowery path, a simple red box waited. Inside I found a tiny note that read: ""Not even 2,000 miles could keep me away from my Valentine."" When I opened the door, Justin was standing inside holding a gorgeous bouquet of roses. It was a truly special moment that I won't ever forget. Later he revealed all the funny close calls he had earlier in the day. One of which involved having to convince airport security to allow him to stand in a cleaning supply closet in order to answer my traditional morning phone call. Communication is key when it comes to long-distance relationships, so I always made sure to call him on my way to my first class each morning. He knew if he didn't answer it might seem a little suspicious, but he had just landed and the airport sound system was spitting out flight info on repeat, which would have been a dead giveaway that he wasn't stuck in the usual 405 traffic. So he hid in the quietest place he could find and our morning chat went on without a glitch. It was a perfect surprise from the perfect Valentine. I hope you all have a wonderful Valentine's Day full of smiles and wonderful memories. 😘 #valentines #valentinesday";valentines,valentinesday;;;910;14

We wanted to take him to the best place we knew, no matter how much travel was required. I brought this special boy home for the first time when I was a freshman. Auburn was the first home he ever had. Something about going back just felt right. While we were having a hard enough time wrapping our minds around the surgery, his chest x-ray came back with bad news. Maddox has cancer. They found a mass in his lungs. They also tested two masses on his body and those came back as mast cell tumors. We are meeting with oncology on Monday to see where we go from here and Tuesday with ophthalmology to figure out what we can do for his eyes as they are causing him great pain. They sent us home with pain medicine last week and he had a severe and rare reaction to the pain medicine. This sweet boy has always been the exception to medical rules. From surviving a horrific pit bull attack that left him with over 100 stitches, to being diagnosed with Evans Syndrome, to being diagnosed with Cushing's, to becoming diabetic, and then eventually losing his vision, I can say with certainty that there has never been a stronger or more loved dog. I have no words to describe our pain and sadness surrounding this latest heartbreaking development. My heart has never hurt worse. My eyes have never cried more. If you could please keep our baby boy in your thoughts and prayers this week, it would be greatly appreciated. Sending lots of love, strength, and prayers to everyone affected by cancer. It sucks. #WorldCancerDay #maltese #dogmom;worldcancerday,maltese,dogmom;;;751;41

Their names are Figs and Craig. Figs was the first one I spotted, but my husband was convinced he was a figment of my imagination. Thus the name Figs. But I can confirm that both Craig and Figs are one hundred percent real and I'm as obsessed with them as I am with this sweeter. ❤️ #figsisreal #soiscraig #liketkit @liketoknow.it http://liketk.it/2uq34 #fashion #wiw #wiwt #ootd #bunny #bunnies #sweater #skirt #ankleboots #ootn #ontheblog #style;figsisreal,soiscraig,liketkit,fashion,wiw,wiwt,ootd,bunny,bunnies,sweater,skirt,ankleboots,ootn,ontheblog,style;liketoknow;;1132;18

The center stone belonged to my husband's grandma and was given to him just before she passed away. This redesigned ring will always carry a link to our family's past and our future. I find that we are craving nostalgia more than ever in this hyper-digital world, and this ring will forever be my sentimental touchstone. Diamonds seem to have that effect on people, even if they’re not in the form of an engagement ring. These precious gemstones are always a good idea for celebrating life's milestones—and as we enter this season of giving (and receiving)—a classic pair of diamond studs or elegant solitaire pendant is something that will always be treasured and never go out of style. I'm so happy to have partnered with @realisadiamond to share my love for these unique, rare and one-of-a-kind gems. #realisrare #myloveisrare #partner;realisrare,myloveisrare,partner;realisadiamond;realisadiamond;1116;18

A diamond that is a direct link to my husband's family — my family. Today, as I looked at one of my favorite photos from our wedding, I couldn't help but feel extra sappy and reflective about the day this diamond became a part of our love story. After 10 years of dating and moving across the country together, Justin whisked me away, blindfolded and in heels, to a Hollywood studio where he proceeded to ask the question I had been waiting years to hear (you can read the full proposal story via link in bio). Not only was it one of the most beautiful rings I had ever seen -- and trust me, I had plenty of years to scour Pinterest -- but I learned later that Justin had spent nearly two years searching for the perfect ring. 
That spring, as he sat across from his grandma putting together one of her many elaborate puzzles, he opened up to her about his search. She had always been his best friend and on that day, while he was visiting from LA, she pulled off her ring, placed it on top of the puzzle, and told him to ""turn my perfect ring into her perfect ring."" That day ended up being the last time he ever saw her. A few weeks later, she passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. Following her wishes, he designed a new ring for me using her diamond and — a few weeks later — asked me to be his wife. 😊👫 Diamonds play an important role in so many people’s love stories and, if you ask me, the best ones come with a memory or story that makes you smile each time you look at them. To learn more about diamonds and other love stories check out  @realisadiamond - And for all the ladies out there eager to get engaged, take my advice and be patient. You never know what kind of extraordinary 'puzzle' God is putting together behind the scenes. 😉 #realisrare #myloveisrare #partner";realisrare,myloveisrare,partner;realisadiamond;;2067;55

The best part about this collection is the formula is free of sulfates, silicones, parabens, gluten, mineral oil and dyes. Not to mention it’s crave-worthy scent! Find out more about why I ditched my old hair care products for this new collection on my #blog today! #ad #HairFood #Hair #Beauty #SulfateFree;blog,ad,hairfood,hair,beauty,sulfatefree;hairfood,simply;;690;4

There’s a laundry list of more glamorous ways to spend an hour than sweating at the gym with dozens of strangers that possess zero respect for personal space. The accommodations are hardly ever ideal. And plus, there’s just, like, so much Netflix to watch. With endless excuses, it’s ultra important to have a perfectly packed ready-to-go gym bag in your car. Think of it as the good angel on your shoulder. She’s sitting right there, nudging you to go. And with that kind of pressure, there’s really no good excuse to derail your daily sweat session. This week on @laurenconrad_com I've put together a little cheat sheet of items that I keep in my gym bag, like my favorite Barre to Bar beauty set from @supergoop , monogrammed camelbak from @pineappleproper and so much more.

My husband and I have been talking about moving out of our condo into a bigger place for the past 4 years, but could never find the time to search for the right place for us! It all seemed very intimidating, 
half the time we couldn't really pin point what it was exactly we were looking for and what kind of place would feel like home but also function as a work space since we do work from home so much! Well, an hour long meeting with @bhhscalifornia and we had the clarity we were looking for! We finally knew exactly what we were needed, our options and a road map to getting there! Special thank you to @alison_turner_real_estate & @kirkhoffman007 for taking this journey with us, knowing us better than we know ourselves, and making this process so enjoyable! P.S.

It’s a new booking platform that connects you with the best places for beauty treatments in your area — and they can also book your medical aesthetic treatments! Don’t really know how I ever booked without it! Didn’t take me 2 minutes, I’ll tell you that. Not to mention, through @Regi I found my favorite new nail place (amazing nail art), lash place and a facial that literally makes my skin glow!

I was introduced to the #444SugarChallenge as an easy way to learn if the sucrose in so many of the foods we eat is causing me to feel less than my best. It’s so easy - just mix 4 TBS of sugar in 4oz of water, drink it on an empty stomach and monitor how it affects you for the next 4-8 hours. Swipe left for more!

I’m always surprised how so many foods have large amounts of #sugar that I would’ve never guessed have any at all. Patients that have this disorder are often misdiagnosed or completely un-diagnosed. Take your own #444SugarChallenge to find out if you have a hidden #sucroseintolerance, but make sure to discuss your symptoms and the 4-4-4 Challenge with your doctor before you take the Challenge. The Challenge can cause severe gas, bloating, and diarrhea, and may not be appropriate for infants, very young children, diabetics, or individuals with severe gastrointestinal symptoms.";ad,444sugarchallenge,sugar,444sugarchallenge,sucroseintolerance;;;19713;124

To protect myself this summer, I’m partnering with @aveenous and adding the protect + hydrate sunscreen as the final step in my skin care regimen. It has broad spectrum UVA + UVB protection and oat to keep my skin hydrated. It’s light and doesn’t feel greasy or heavy like other sunscreens I’ve tried! I also like to start my mornings by drinking a lot of water - I have so much more energy if I do this instead of just coffee. I try to drink this entire @smartwater before noon!

I’m excited to be working with @aveenous to show what essentials I bring with me. My pool bag used to be filled with magazines or books but now it’s mostly filled with baby snacks and supplies. The only two things of mine in there now are my sunscreen and water! I love the @aveenous protect + hydrate sunscreen since it provides broad spectrum UVA + UVB protection but it’s also good for my face because it has oat to keep my skin moisturized. The pool I’m going to only allows sealed water bottles, so I buy @smartwater from @walgreens. It’s my favorite tasting water but I also love the size of the bottle- I’ll drink it at the pool and then refill it at home to track my hydration! Any advice for fun summer activities with a baby?

If you don’t know what the sale is- they put out a ton of their new fall clothes on sale first and then they go back to their regular price after. It’s my favorite time to stock up on great basics for the season [leggings, cardigans, booties etc]. The cardigan I’m wearing in this picture is going to be included in the sale too! It sold out really fast last fall and they’re bringing it back 🙌 Last year I filmed a video on all of my top picks + best basics for fall and timed it with the sale so everything I showed would be at a discounted rate and you guys really liked it! Going to post another video of fall essentials for this year and ill include my top picks from the sale again.

I prayed for a strong willed, sassy baby girl and boy did I get one 😂 I could tell that she was a diva even when I was pregnant with her- she has such a little personality and made that clear from the beginning! The last 74 weeks have felt like a rollercoaster- from an early bleed, a lump in my chest, morning sickness / throwing up daily, placenta previa, high blood pressure and a crazy intense 32 hour labor to jaundice, extra nights under the lights, acid reflux, colic, struggling to breastfeed, sleepless days, nights, tears and depression- I can’t believe we made it here. All those stresses seem like a distant memory and I’m so thankful for this sweet baby girl. To all the new moms or expecting moms out there- I want to tell you that it gets better and the journey is so worth it. We now have an 8 month old who brings us so much joy and laughter every day. She says ‘mama’ and leans in to give us kisses. She smiles and lights up every time we walk into the room. She giggles at our jokes and makes even bad days seem better. I love seeing the world through her eyes and she has made me even more thankful for what truly matters most: family. Thank you, Kennedy Rose, for being the baby girl I prayed for 🖤 PS. I tagged Kennedy’s account in this picture if you’d like to see her monthly updates because I’ll be posting them there 💕;;;;11220;56

This is one of my go to outfits for spring. Jean shorts + bodysuit are @revolve, my duster is from a few seasons ago but I’ll link some similar options in stories for you guys. A neutral duster is one of the pieces that would make my capsule wardrobe. I wear it with shorts, tank dresses, leggings- you name it. It’s also one of my go to pieces for traveling- it’s the perfect comfy layer for a flight! PS. looks like you guys really enjoyed casual story time on stories yesterday. Your DMs were KILLING me- you’re all hilarious and I don’t deserve you 😂

These pieces will definitely be staying in my closet: a neutral jacket, a great basic white tee and black skinny jeans. I’m planning on keeping mostly items that can be mixed and matched together to create classic, easy outfits! Linked these particular pieces in the @liketoknow.it app! [ps I think some of you guys hate when I share like to know it posts but they are not sponsored- I get asked what I’m wearing and where is it from a lot so this is my way of answering all of your questions in advance so you can just go find what you’re looking for and see if it’s still available without waiting for my response. I find this app so helpful in case you are someone who gets outfit inspo and likes to shop online! So just know if I post a #liketkit post it means that I spent time linking out everything I’m wearing in advance so you don’t have to wait or search]

I had been fighting nausea + exhaustion all week and just wanted to feel like myself, so @codycarson_ and I went out to dinner. I had convinced myself that I would be fine, but I started to cry the minute our waitress set down my food. The smell made me want to vomit, I was crying that I wasted our time and then I was crying because I was crying. The servers all looked at Cody like he was a jerk who had done something to make me cry and he quietly told them to cancel the dessert as I continued to sob over my salmon. This year I’m thankful that we have our baby girl with us and that I can eat full meals again, but I still cry just as much in public 😂 #tbt;tbt;codycarson;;5511;44

She gets bored easily and wants to be on the move. She’s always trying to sit up and loves standing like a big girl [seriously- she’s so tall. She’s filling out 6-9 month sleepers and these leggings are for a 12 month old 😳] She actually turned four months on February 20, but mom was a little late to take her picture 😂 Unlike mommy, Kennedy LOVES being on time- she started the four month sleep regression the day she turned four months! 😴 she used to sleep from 10-6, now it’s always a surprise!

I shared our gallery wall on stories this weekend and got so many DM’s about it so I thought I would answer your questions here. This is technically the floor to ceiling wall from @framebridge- we just hung 9 of the 12 frames. I picked photos from some of our most special times together- our engagement, wedding and newborn pictures!  The frames are a champagne color so they can look more gold or silver depending on the room. Some of you asked how we spaced the wall so evenly- #framebridge sends a hanging guide so we just positioned it where we wanted on our wall and hung from there! Next up- our new entry way table is coming tomorrow and our dining chairs should be here this week! Lmk if you like seeing these home updates!;framebridge;framebridge;;15556;162

She’s only 3 months, but is already filling out the length of her 3-6 month sleepers! Cody says she got her fathers legs 🙄 Kennedy Rose, I am so thankful to be your mama.

It’s made of pure sugar, so it’s free of harsh chemicals and is even safe to use as a lip scrub [my fav way to use this one]. The coffee grounds also help make my skin look less fatigued / more awake than I really am. #lorealparispartner PS.

If you haven’t seen the video: I was induced at 37 weeks because I had high blood pressure. When Kennedy was born, her bilirubin levels were elevated and the doctors told me that she needed as much fluid as possible to flush it out of her system. My milk hadn’t come in yet and they started her on formula from day 1. At first, I was devastated. I was worried she would never breast feed after taking a bottle and I was so sad because it was not at all what I had originally planned or wanted. After weeks of trying [and crying, on both our parts] she finally is interested in breast feeding, but I’m not making enough and we still need to supplement. I’ve learned that you can’t plan anything when it comes to labor because you really don’t know what will happen until you experience it yourself. I’m also so thankful that formula exists because it helped our daughter to get healthy and out of the hospital. After a week of mixing formula and bottles [even in the middle of the night] we decided to upgrade to the #babybrezza #formulaproadvanced. It automatically mixes Kennedy’s bottles at the push of a button [and in 1oz increments so we can make as much as she needs]. Plus Kennedy loves their bottles- they are natural / shaped to help also encourage breast feeding. We love how fast it is and that Cody can use it to feed and bond with Kenny too! Thank you moms for sharing your similar labor / feeding stories with me- they made me feel safe and encouraged to share ours with you too 🖤 #brezzatime;babybrezza,formulaproadvanced,brezzatime;;;8072;64

Today is her one month birthday, which has been the source of many debates in our family [four weeks on Saturday, but not an actual month until today, the 20th. Four weeks doesn’t always equal a month #science #math] She loves being snuggled and is happiest in our arms [some would dare say she is only happy while being held, but this is a birthday post and I’m trying to keep it positive here]. She weighs 8lbs and 6oz- a full two pounds heavier than when we brought her home! [I don’t want to say we’re great parents or anything but if the shoe fits..] She hates being cold, loves baths, naps and massages. She might look like her daddy, but so far she definitely has mama’s personality. Happy one month birthday, baby girl! Can you wake up already? I know I just begged you to go to sleep but I already miss you 😭🖤";science,math;;;12213;125

Trying to enjoy this last part of pregnancy / feeling baby kicks as much I can. We’re just a few short weeks [or days] away from meeting her and that means my anxiety about labor / delivery is in full swing. We were on our hospital tour and everyone was like ‘wow, what a nice room!’ and I was like ‘this isn’t the Waldorf, this is still a hospital and I’m freaking out’. I’d like an epidural and a glass of wine just thinking about it 😳 so what did I decide to do with all of my anxiety? Chop my hair off, obviously 😂 nothing says ‘I’m going through it’ like drastically altering your hair!

Helena and I are due about a month apart and she has the cutest little boy (who is close to B’s age). She is one of my favorite accounts to follow, her style is flawless, classic, and timeless. I thought it would be fun to have her share her 3 essential maternity pieces and have us both style them for some outfit inspo! And with that I give you Helena from Brooklyn Blonde: “So excited to be part of this series! 3 of my must-have essentials this pregnancy have been:

Look 1: Bandage/Fitted dresses:
While I'm not the biggest bandage/fitted dress person with my non-pregnancy wardrobe, they've become such a staple for me with this pregnancy! I've truly loved embracing the bump and I find them  more flattering than most things out there.

Look 2: Skirts with a stretch band:
Another one of my wardrobe staples has been skirts, typically satin or silk, that have a stretch band. They've been easy to grow into, are easy to hike up as the belly grows and look great paired with tees or layered with sweaters, lightly folded under.

Look 3: Sneakers:
To continue from the above, because I've been wearing so many more dresses, I've never reached for sneakers more than I have with this pregnancy. Comfort aside (which is obviously key when pregnant and with a toddler at home), I love how it balances out the more feminine pieces (like dresses and skirts) that I've been living in.

xoxoxo, Helena”

Which look is your favorite? And what are some of your other maternity essentials? Make sure to follow Helena for her effortless style!";;brooklynblonde1;;8502;50

Did a Q&A the other day and someone brought up the “no like” concept Instagram has been testing out. I asked you guys what you thought about it and there were so many interesting point of views I wanted to bring it here for discussion.

If you haven’t heard Instagram is testing the idea of taking likes away from Instagram. Personally I haven’t decided if I like or dislike the concept. I think it will really change the space for influencers and businesses and I feel like it may turn into more like a Pinterest platform where people over post and don’t care about what they post. I do see the benefits for younger kids and the pressure social media can put on them... anyways what’s your guys thoughts?";;;;18701;410

It just makes me happy.

I passed like 2 or 3 kids on the trail with these cute stuffed animals dying over how cute they were and hoping when I showed Beckam he would think it’s cute ( I’m lol at myself saying hoping he would think it’s cute but Beckam isn’t a stuffed animal guy, his thing is candy and treats usually over any toy) he has only 1 stuffed animal he plays with (a shark I got him when we went to shark aquarium a couple years ago. So I knew my chances were slim 😂) but when we got to the gift shop he saw the goat, squeezed him tight and his eyes lit up. “Can we keep him 😍” I’m not sure if I was more excited or him 😂 but he hasn’t put “Brody the goaty” down since ❤️ #glaciernationalpark";glaciernationalpark;;;11500;83

- It’s so fun to get new baby clothes but you won’t use half the clothes you buy, the first couple weeks you are in survival mode and put them in whatever you can find, basic onesies, not everyday is a cute outfit day.
- It’s okay if you don’t breastfeed. There’s so much pressure around this, and if it doesn’t work for you it’s ok. Do what’s best for you and your family and don’t feel pressure to breastfeed if you can’t.
- All the movies made me think labor was going to be crazy, I was in labor with Beckam for 20+ hours. I actually didn’t think the the birthing process was that bad, but no one warned me how uncomfortable and painful it would be after! The mama pads and giant granny panties. Super sexy 😂
- Be okay asking for help. 99% of the time people want to help you and don’t know how ❤️
- Being pregnant is truly a miracle, but sometimes it’s emotional. You will laugh, you will cry, and somedays you will just be emotional and don’t know why. Embrace the emotions and know your not alone. It’s totally normal!
- Sometimes the baby kicks will freak you out. I lovvvvve feeling the baby move but if I’m totally honest there have also been days as he gets bigger and you see him literally roll on your belly it kind of feels like an alien 😂 you are not a bad mom if you don’t fall in love with every kick and movement when your pregnant.
- It truly is amazing what your body does, love your body and all the beautiful shapes, stretch marks, and curves you gain. These are beauty marks of your journey and it’s ok if you don’t feel like they are everyday.
- You are enough, you are strong, you are amazing! I can’t count how many times I’ve googled things when I feel lost and there’s 50 million answers contradicting themselves. Follow your intuition and trust what your doing - don’t overthink it. You are going to be an amazing mom!! ❤️";;;;18298;326

1. Our kids melt down and fight at home and they still melt down and fight on trips too but the time spent is different then at home because there is less distractions and you get to experience new things together and you have more of their attention. 
2. Seeing the kids grow - this trip especially it was so cool Mara learned 15 Italian words. She is very shy and seeing her make eye contact and say hello, please and thank you in Italian to strangers was really cool to see her out of her comfort zone. 
3. Realize their limits. Our hardest day was when we walked florence in the dead heat. About two hours in, after they had done the fun rides and had gelato it turned melt down mode. We know this from traveling before  with them not to go out walking ALL DAY if it’s not by the ocean, but for some reason we forgot 🤦🏼‍♀️ 4. Plan downtime. If we’re not by the ocean or a pool we go out early in the morning take an afternoon break around 12-4 and then go out again for dinner and sunset. If we are by the ocean we play until like 3 and then have the kids relax for 2-3 hours before we go out again at night. 
5. Plan games! In some of the smaller city areas there isn’t as many activities for kids so we plan games. This time Cody and I made different scavenger hunts for the kids, just write down things to find on a piece of paper (I’ll post a pic on next slide if ones we did) another day we did what’s the coolest thing you can find for 5euro. So come up with easy creative games that encourage them to look around their surroundings :) It’s 100% hard some days and honestly as the kids have gotten older some days I think they would rather just be with their cousins 😛 but I think the bond you create and having one on one family time is so important and I look forward to this time with them every year!";;;;18704;140

This time Cody got to drive which made it a whole new adventure 😛 but both ways (with a guide or driving on your own) is such a blast. We went up to San Fruttoso and Portofino. Portofino was a lot smaller than I imagined, still so beautiful but I was kind of surprised. I imagined it the size of Positano, but it’s nestled in this cute bay and surrounded by so much beautiful greenery. We saw like 50 jelly fish at San fruttuoso, the kids were loving finding them all. The highlight was the kids driving with Cody at the end they were laughing so hard doing donuts in the water. 🌊(Thanks @noken for putting together such a magical day) #italytrip #portofino #nokenpartner #sanfruttuoso #babybump;italytrip,portofino,nokenpartner,sanfruttuoso,babybump;noken;;22917;158

It reminded me how much I love what I do & the friends I’ve met who also share their style & parts of their lives simultaneously on the internet, and how they’re life friends and how special this industry is, and how lucky/thankful I am to be a part of it.  To shame someone for finding success and happiness must be extremely sad and lonely 🧜🏼‍♀️ we should all try to silence our ego and be happy for others 💘 I know it’s extremely hard! Even I get jealous of others sometimes because I am only human, but I promise if you put the negative energy into yourself and your own happiness you won’t even notice all the “BS” around you!

It started out by me falling off the bicycle early November last year. I was trying to pass a scooter 🛴 on a bike path, the path was windy so I miscalculated my speed and was at high speed right next to that scooter on a curvy road turn when the back wheel of the bicycle slipped and left me on the ground braking with my entire body. Needless to say clothes was ripped, body was bruised and people were looking at me weirdly scared for my life. My knee somehow took most of the impact. I ended up with a potential torn meniscus diagnosis and in severe pain 24-7. MRI was taking forever to order and pain didn’t diminish even overdosing on painkillers. Accidents like this really help you start appreciating simple things in life. Laying alone in pain a whole night long every single night = not fun at all. It took me a little over a month to find the one and only @drraj who immediately without waiting for MRI results instructed to start with PRP injections (you might have seen those in my stories). You can also swipe right but be warned there are #needles involved. #PRPinjections are used for wide variety of purposes but in my particular case it was in hopes to speed up natural healing (and avoid surgery). We drew blood from my vein, they separated plasma from it and injected it back to the muscle. It’s supposed to help repair the muscle and heal faster, very popular for #sportinjuries . And it really did help. I did 2 PRP injections a few months apart. After the first injection my pain went down to 60% of time instead of 💯, after the second one the pain stayed for about 20%. The rest of the healing took time and other natural procedures that I’ll share with you in the next post 🤗 But I don’t know what I would have done without PRP by @drraj - any #orthopedic injury, he is your guy 🙌 #kneeinjury;kneejourney,needles,prpinjections,sportinjuries,orthopedic,kneeinjury;drraj,drraj;;3296;85

I’ve teamed with Aflac and the @aflacduck to help bring awareness to their new supplemental insurance that I hold near and dear to my heart because of what my family went through #ad In the last few years, my family and I had to go through a series of battles, which all started with my mom and subsequently my grandma being diagnosed with cancer. Apart from all the pain and mental challenges, medical bills piled up, as well. People can spend thousands of dollars on critical illness recovery. Now, Aflac will be offering new, more robust critical illness insurance policies that can help families have peace of mind without breaking the bank. To learn more about how Aflac can help with expenses health insurance doesn’t cover, check out the link in my bio. #aflachelpdesk;ad,aflachelpdesk;aflacduck;;6446;50

- Visited 10 countries (including 6 new ones).
- Tried many things for the first time: from exotic foods when exploring each new country, to experiences like zip lining, ATV-ing and off-roading, a helicopter ride, snorkeling, a hot air balloon ride.
- Enrolled in therapy - huge game changer in my life.
- Made new friends, strengthened connections with old ones, completely cut off some people.
- Won an award, was named one of the top 25 influencers in LA, spoke at various panels about the business of social media.
- Celebrated my birthday for the first time in years.
- Made strong choices in personal life by not settling for mistreatment and disrespect as a result of allowing wrong people in my life. - This year, like never before, I got disappointed in toxic and shameless people on personal and professional levels, but at the same time like never before I got inspired by the true friends and diligent people by my side, or at work. - Got a serious injury for the first time, still a pending battle for 2019. - Somehow this year I got to fully understand that our time on this planet is limited, and many things are not worth wasting time on, but some are definitely worth living for, like love, family, principles, friendships, community - simply put it… people. 
I don’t know what 2019 will bring. The future is unknown. In any case, I am determined to grow and learn, hopefully be more focused and try not to waste energy on wrong paths. I wish you the same - growth, focus, health, happiness and most importantly - respect, to yourself, the planet and others . Peace and namaste 🙏 🎉✌️";;;;6838;88

Just a few things cryo can do for you: - Decrease muscle recovery time
- Enhance athletic performance
- Support energy levels
- Reduce inflammation
- Improve circulation
- Manage pain
- Elevate mood
- Improve sleep
- Promote weight loss
- Boost collagen production

For me personally, it helped me manage pain, extreme stress levels, sleep problems and control my mood. 
Highly suggest trying this for yourself at @coastcryo if you live close! #dianasbeauty #marinadelrey #venicebeach";cryotherapy,dianasbeauty,marinadelrey,venicebeach;coastcryo,coastcryo;;6456;69

Currently overworked and overwhelmed (another exciting trip coming up😉), so that moment seems like eternity ago. Not complaining though, just showing you guys that pretty Instagram content is only a small percent of what’s happening in real life.

We looked outside the window and could see the smoke from about 15 blocks away. The city was silent and stood still. I will always vividly remember that feeling. After that New Yorkers got to work. They lined up to give blood, volunteered and we’re insanely kind to one another. “In scary times, look for the helpers”. No matter how long I live in LA, New York will always be home.

One minute I’m fine, next minute I’m crying uncontrollably. It’s been almost 6 months and honestly it’s still hard to even say his name without crying. But I wanted to share this...I wasn’t sure how I felt about keeping his remains but Damien thought it was a good idea, so we did. About two weeks ago we set up this little area in the living room for him and it actually did make me feel a little better. A photo, his name tag and his remains inside this beautiful plantURN our friend @boycestudio made for us. It’s nice to have this area for him. Sometimes it’s hard to see and sometimes it’s really comforting. He was my everything for 14 years so I know healing will take time and I try to think of how lucky I was to have him for so long. Give your fur babies an extra kiss tonight from me & Hayden. Kissing and snuggling Hayden (even when I did it too much and annoyed him) is definitely what I miss the most. ❤️;nationaldogday;boycestudio;;790;76

Gone are the days of fun brunches & blogger events for me.  Shopping, photo shoots & meets ups are rare. Most days I’m running to auditions, meetings or writing. Today is no exception. I’m running to a doctor’s appointment, two commercial auditions then home to write for a few hours, meeting a friend for happy hour (that’s fun!) then going to a pilot reading.  None of this is Instagram worthy lol but it’s what makes me happy. So for anyone who has been following me since my busier “blogger days” thanks for sticking with me! This new chapter is extremely exciting for me and I can’t wait to be able to share more. At least I’ll be doing some traveling this summer! That’ll be fun. 😊;;;;807;60

I adopted him on 08/23/05 and was told he was a year and a half making his birthday 02/23, the same day as mine! But I wanted to give him his own day so every year I celebrate it a few days before mine. (And I share this story every year like a crazy person) I’ve had this little guy for 14 years and I cherish every minute I spend with him. Especially now! He’s such a special dog and I love him more than anything. Happy Birthday Hayden! I love you so much. And I’m crying. PS - His Happy Birthday song video in stores. He’s pretty cute.

✨
Though I’ve played around with writing for years, it wasn’t until the end of 2017 when I decided to really go for it. In 2018, after directing @eggdayfilm I decided to write my first pilot. Thanks to encouragement and amazing notes from the hubs and close friends I was able to complete a draft that is now in development and that landed me an amazing agent.
✨
I share this because, all this good news, came after SO MUCH DOUBT. I was afraid to call myself a writer and still suffer from “imposter syndrome” but nevertheless I’m plugging away. I have a lot of ideas and I hope to see them (or at least one of them) come to life one day. My dream is to create a show I also get to act on and to write on shows that are telling unique stories. Because now more than ever we need stories from POC and women!
✨
So if you want to write or direct or produce then GO FOR IT! You never know what might come of it. Trust me, I’m still pinching myself. Okay that’s it. Thanks for listening. I gotta go write now 😜
✨
PS - These are just a few of the amazing people who have helped me on this writing journey: @damienfahey @karlihenriquez @thatgirlkarengraci @duhlarik @davehill48 @bferr310 @claytonfarris @bgbstudio - it takes a village!";;eggdayfilm,damienfahey,karlihenriquez,thatgirlkarengraci,duhlarik,davehill48,bferr310,claytonfarris,bgbstudio;;1422;249

I often think about how lucky our children are to have a home filled with love, easy access to mental and medical support and so much more that we can easily take for granted. 
Last week, I had the huge honor of attending the @SaveTheChildren Gala as a guest of @jnj. #jnj has been such a strong partner in Save the Children's emergency efforts for over a 20 years and their common purpose: a world where no child dies from preventable causes and every child has the opportunity to reach their full potential. They strongly believe that health is at the heart of human progress and that begins by caring for the youngest and most in need. Last week #jnj pledged $5MM to Save the Children's Disaster Relief fund. 
It was such a privilege to be able to attend an evening filled with so much love and hope and I am so grateful to be able to support @jnj and their continuous efforts.  #livehealthylivewell  #sponsored";jnj,jnj,livehealthylivewell,sponsored;savethechildren,jnj,jnj;;4965;49

I was overwhelmed by how many incredible answers I got! Tips I would never even think of (obviously not being in the boat, quite yet), but once I read them, I thought ""aha! that makes so much sense."" Below are a few of them, but I've also included a link to my blogpost in the bio, which has a few more super helpful tips. If you have more to share, please include them in the comments. I'm possible I'm not the only one who could benefit from them! 
A few helpful tips from transitioning from 1-2+: 📍Your toddler will need you more than your new baby. Physically, yes, your baby will need you. Mentally, your first will need you more and the new baby will not remember, but your older one will. 📍When family and friends come over to see the new baby, kindly remind them to shower the older sibling with attention before making contact with the baby. 📍If financially feasible, have the older one in daycare/school. 📍Never ""blame"" the baby for not being able to do things in regards to your oldest. Example: ""I can't pick you up because of the baby."" Instead, say you're tired or your back hurts. 📍Stay in the same routine you have. Your new baby will follow suit. 📍Have somewhere safe that you can put the baby if your first child needs your attention. 📍Don't be afraid to ask for help!  Outsource as much as possible. 📍Don't  allow yourself to neglect your own recovery (mind and body) in the process. 📍It will be a shit show at first, but it will get easier with time!

I guess that tends to happen once you're ""in the clear"" stage, usually after the first trimester. It's true what they say: you're so busy running around after your first child, there's little time to stop and think about what size fruit or vegetable your new baby is growing into. 
There will be moments where I'm like ""holy shit! 🤯in 4 months, we're about to have another little human to take care!"" The anxious side of me thinks about dressing two little children for a NYC winter, getting two kids in and out of a carseat and the clutter! I know it's going to double and that stresses me out more than more things. But then excitement takes over and I think about Nate as an older brother and getting to experience what Keith and I never have, a sibling.  Quite honestly, I have many of you to thank. You guys have calmed my fears (from the room sharing to actually going from 1-2), made me feel less nervous and given me so much valuable advice.

That’s me peaking out of the living room of our airbanb window (Keith’s idea for a photo) 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻 every very single time I’d catch a view of this backdrop, numerous times a day, I’d have to ask myself “is this real life?!” All credit goes to @krystal_bick who found this #LakeComo gem last year. I am including a link in my stories for her original post. It was off the beaten path, in the town of Torno and away from the bustling towns of Lake Como. We did not mind it, but definitely not for everyone. A few things to note below:

Pros: the backdrop, the private balcony basically ON the lake, the sprawling landscape, the history! It was all out of a fairytale. Breathtaking is not the word and it felt super private. However, you will need a car if you plan to stay here! There are two restaurants in town (a 15 minute walk from the home), but everything else is a drive away.

The sound of water as you sleep is magical! Feels like a fake noise machine is on. 
Not as much of a Pro: The apartment itself is old and very basic. It’s comfortable and very clean, but you are not staying here to stay indoors. Don’t book and expect anything grand or glamorous inside. Not ideal with kids, but we made it work! Took the little foam mattress from  upstairs and bought it into the main bedroom. Also, wish there were more lamps/light at night. I am HUGE on hotel rooms and apartments being very well lit at night. Puts me in a better mood. 
Any other questions, ask below! The property and inside photos could also be found on her listing. #lakecomo";lakecomo,lakecomo;krystal;;7582;117

Stopped by this place in #Bellagio and it did not disappoint, but still searching for one that knocks my socks off. We are heading to Tuscany next, so the search shall continue there! 🍨🇮🇹🍨🇮🇹🍨🇮🇹
Also, thoughts on Bellagio: 
Incredibly beautiful and I get why it’s so iconic, but a little too mobbed and touristy for our liking (says the tourist..). Glad we did not stay there as we prefer a bit more of a relaxed atmosphere. And yes, the stairs and streets made it a bit harder with a stroller and toddler, especially in the summer heat. Poor Keith (who is lifting and pushing)😂, but at least the gelato is being burned off. #lakecomo #travelingwithkids #hodneitalyadventure";bellagio,lakecomo,travelingwithkids,hodneitalyadventure;;;4756;91

That combination, along with being patient, has really evened out my complexion. I mention patience because remember, it all takes time and does not happen overnight.

1) I'm currently reading (almost finished) Daisy Jones and the Six. Has anyone read? It's so good! I'll be on on the @badonpaperpodcast (cc: @graceatwood & @beccamfreeman) podcast discussing it (among other fun things) in a few weeks! 
2) I'm super late, but I'm finally watching #SchittsCreek. It took me about a season to get into it, but now, I love it! Thank you to all who've convinced me to keep with it.
3) I'm in the process of planning a June family vacation. We're in the midst of deciding between Italy, Greece & Spain (craving charming neighborhoods, some water and incredible food). I've been going back and forth with @travelcouturier , who has been helping me narrow down our choices. Will keep you all posted, especially since we will be traveling with a toddler!

At some point it just becomes normal and NOT being busy is the thing producing anxiety.

If you’ve been reading awhile, then you know how adamant I am that art and beauty matter - they are so important, an antidote to much of the pain we experience in today’s world. (TED Talk by @aestheticsofjoy was also a huge inspiration for us.) There are many stories I’d love to share one day - how we came up with this idea, and why we took such a huge leap despite having no way of knowing what would be waiting for us on the other side. The many, many moments of doubt, wondering what in the world we had gotten ourselves into. The physical tiredness (painting/decorating this many walls in such a short time felt like boot camp) and the sweetness of joy and assuredness that we were in the right place, that would catch us at the most unlikely moments, and take my breath away. I have never felt more alive - not because of the thankfulness we feel for Wall Crawl’s success so far but because of the spiritual journey leading up to this, that made it possible to enjoy it in such a pure way. Not needing it to be anything other than whatever it becomes, showing up fully but not being invested in any certain outcome and knowing, ultimately, that nothing I do or accomplish defines my worth. 🙏  It is, simply: ridiculously, over-the-top FUN. And I’m just so thankful to be along for the ride! 💕💏

Use code J20 through August 8th, link in bio or comment for DM!! 🌴 Looking at the entire collection together makes my eyes well up a little. It has never really been a dream of mine to have a clothing line, but I am so thankful that Katie Martinez asked me to partner with her to create a #fairtrade line last year!! 🤗

I said “yes” because I trust her - she’s been running an ethical clothing company (@Elegantees) for almost a decade now! And two, I saw a need in my own closet - and the clothing industry as a whole - for affordable fair trade clothing that is not super plain and doesn’t mean sacrificing on style. 👗

It wasn’t until the final Eden & Ivy samples arrived in my mailbox a year later, though, that I really fell in love with this collection. My chin hit the floor! They SLAYED these designs! The quality is outstanding, the fit is outstanding, the fabric (95% organic cotton) is gorgeous. As Katie told me about the women in Nepal who made these clothes in a factory that she co-owns, and how they are survivors of sex trafficking and when taught a valuable life skill like sewing it restores their dignity and gives them hope - I was in SO DEEP. Maybe it sounds funny, but I feel connected to them just by wearing these clothes. 💕

The prices are already fantastic (everything is $38-59), however, Katie is offering a 20% off coupon for one week!! You can use code J20 through August 8th on the entire Eden & Ivy collection, which you can find on the blog today and at elegantees.com/collections/eden-ivy !! 🌴";fairtrade;elegantees;;825;30

My new fair trade clothing line launches this week and this is a sneak peek!!!💃💕🎉 If you've been reading for long then you know I’m passionate about two things: 🌈Having the time of your life with clothes on a budget (the audacity to enjoy yourself!) 😍 Ethically made clothes (because all humans deserve to be treated fairly!) These two passions are often in direct opposition with one another, as ethically made clothing tends to be super plain AND super expensive! So I was beyond excited when Katie, the founder of @elegantees, asked if I would design a spring/summer clothing collection to try to fill this hole in the market. This top has not one but three ruffles on the sleeve, is super soft, and only $44 - PLUS it was handmade by survivors of sex-trafficking in Nepal, who were paid fair wages. Yes, I think I have died and gone to heaven, officially. You can pre-order this top now, and I’ll be sharing more styles over the next month as the full collection launches! xoxo, J. #fairtrade #ethicalstyle #ethicalfashion #budgetfashion #lookforless #teacherstyle #orlandoblogger;fairtrade,ethicalstyle,ethicalfashion,budgetfashion,lookforless,teacherstyle,orlandoblogger;elegantees;;3466;404

Year after year I’ve visited Oahu and been far too intimidated by the “stairs of doom,” but this year was different. I was EXCITED to finally try Koko Head. I thought I was gonna race up this mountain after all those leg days at the gym but maybe another year of leg days 😂😭 On those first few steps when the heat hit me, I realized that I knew I could do it, just not in record time like I hoped. Confidence may have gotten me started but it was actually dedication that got me to the top of Koko Head. Dedication to accomplish my goal. And that’s what matters! ❤️ Make goals, and tackle them. Today I want to remind you all to challenge yourselves, and push yourself harder every day because change is inevitable and growth is optional.;;;;17663;244

I’m the oldest of 4 girls, and I have a B.S. in Advertising and Illustration. Growing up, my sisters and I were taught by our mom that fashion was unimportant and shallow, and although it can be sometimes, I always loved it! I recognized that what we wear and how we wear it can change the way we feel about ourselves and make us feel more confident.  When I turned 18 and was allowed to get a license, I finally felt a little freedom. I could go shopping where I wanted and without judgement! Granted, as a poor college student I could barely afford anything but it didn’t matter. I had so much fun exploring my personal style in college and in early 2012 I began to post pictures of my outfits on community fashion websites. No one in my family supported me in the beginning of my blogging journey except my youngest sister Irene.  Everyone told me I was wasting my time but I was passionate about sharing what I loved so I continued.  I had to work really really hard to get where I am now and I never expected things would happen the way they did, but I’m so grateful!  My dad had his own software business growing up and I always used to look at him and see how much he worked day and night and say “I’m NEVER going to have my own business!”. It’s crazy to look back at that because now I do and even though it has its ups and downs, I love it because it’s so rewarding! I truly try to never take anything for granted, not my health, my family, my followers, or the companies I work with.  The beautiful cities I get to visit and the amazing views I get to see still take my breath away. If I could give you guys one piece of advice I would say to never forget where you came from, but don’t be afraid to recognize who you really are and where your passions will lead you. Take chances! As one of my favorite quotes says, “Be bold and courageous. When you look back on your life, you’ll regret the things you didn’t do more than the ones you did.” -H. Jackson Brown ❤️;;;;15884;177

•
Something my mom started teaching me (it was the same time she likely learned about it as well) when I was around 14 was how important it was to eat organic. In the Bay Area I can always find organic food at Whole Foods or a few stands at the farmers market, but almost never at restaurants or other grocery stores (Safeway, Luckys and Trader Joe’s do have a small organic section). What about you guys? Where are you and do you eat organic? 🍓🍌🥬

On my face today, the Glacial Oceanic Clay mask. Key ingredient being Canadian glacial oceanic clay, which removes impurities from the skin, while infusing it with moisture. My skin felt so soft after this! Infact you can watch me ramble on about it in my IG stories, if you like. haha

I’m not an activist. But showing up today to march along side so many people that care made me feel like I am part of something greater. It let me feel the power of the collective, when we all come together with a purpose, it felt electric to be on the streets today. #ChangeIsComing. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The conversation we face with this issue is uncomfortable, cause it cannot be sugar coated. It’s life or death, especially for the generations that follow. It is clear we can’t just live our lives the way we have until today. 🌎 What the earth has given us until today will no longer be the norm, if we carry on with business as usual. I’m sure dinasours thought they had all the time in the world to live their lives as well. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m not a perfect civilian but I’m going to try and do my part even more then I have to this day. Educating myself and acting where I can to care for the future of the planet and it’s people. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
We don’t have time to stand by and pretend nothing is happening. The next generation is feeling the impact of our negligence. They are so brave and face this issue with open eyes, rather then pretending it won’t effect me or you. It already has.

Freeeee, present and focused on the here and now! It also got me thinking deeply about sharing things and what it all means to who I am as a person. Does it define who I am or add to who I am, or both, or neither. Needless to say, I have a love / hate relationship with my own social media these days.

In partnership with @biotherm, I am so excited to share with you their Biotherm Water Lovers initiative to protect our oceans at a local and global scale. I love that companies are waking up and contributing to causes that give back to our earth in some way. 
A month ago, I had the chance to participate in the first Biotherm Canada Clean up action in Vancouver and this year, they will be donating $1 to @shorelinecleanup for each product sold at @shoppersdrugmartofficial from June 8 to 14 to keep our shorelines clean! Everything just feels a little better when being a consumer also contributes to a meaningful cause. At the smallest scale you can make a change toward protecting our planet, it doesn’t need to be an unattainable action, start small and see where the “feel good” takes you. 
I would love for you to partake in the Water Lovers challenge! Simply share a photo of your favourite beach using the tag #BiothermWLCanada and tell us why protecting our planet’s waters is meaningful to you! ‪On July 8th‬ 2 lucky winners will be announced on Biotherm Canada’s Facebook and will receive a #Biotherm prize pack valued at $285!

Maybe today is when you start being more aware of your plastic usage. It’s easy just don’t buy single use plastic bottles or containers. 🌍 You hold ALL the power, every decision you make to be more conscious and aware of how you are creating your footprint on this earth counts. No action is to small and yes every bit matters. Sharing some ideas on small things you can change in my IGStories. Become more aware. 📷 by @mikebishop.tv from trip to Iceland a few years ago.

Had the amazing opportunity to join the @vitruvi team at @ted this week. It’s title being: “bigger than us” is exactly what I am taking away from the experience. TED, is a beautiful reminder that outside of our day to day bubble there are things happening that are truly bigger than you can imagine. The highlight to me isn’t that I should start working on my own “TED talk” 😂 but to be less complacent, be even more curious, go the extra step, be a little more brave, ask the deeper question, research the facts and dream bigger. That’s how we all can take collective steps to creating expansion on a day to day level. 📷 by @brit_gill #BiggerThanUs #TEDVanvouver #Lessons;biggerthanus,tedvanvouver,lessons;vitruvi,ted,brit;;566;7

I suddenly became incredibly aware of this thing I do that is termed “imposter syndrome”. When I am in certain social situations I find myself feeling like I am a guest that is not meant to be there. Or just someone’s plus one that stumbled on something amazing, that wasn’t meant for me. I’ve had this feeling before so many times and always convinced myself that it’s actually true, getting stuck on that eeky feeling and just covering it up with niceties about other people’s work. Anything to draw the attention away from myself. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Realizing that it is in-fact just a thought, felt so freeing. It gave me permission to label it as NOT defining me. A practice I learnt from meditation. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As soon as I noticed it coming up again and again that day, I basically just told the thought to go away and that I was worthy of being there just like everyone else. I then became more comfortable in my skin, which allowed me to be more myself, which then aloud me to take in the information the way it was meant to. I learnt so much more because I wasn’t caught up in some weird thought spiral. This is a practice I am going to have to keep working on, like any practices. ☺️ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Also telling someone about this made me realize that I am not alone, that others in any industry or at any event can be experiencing the same feelings as well. Humans are so interesting.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Anyway, here to say, you are not alone and if you are somewhere you ARE meant to be there. You ARE worthy. That is what I am going to keep telling myself when the thought creeps back in. Also 🙋🏻‍♀️ if you have ever felt this before.... 😘 📷 by @brit_gill #FoodForThought";foodforthought;brit;;759;33

The point is, when I try to form them into concrete thoughts on paper (in the future, this will be typed on a keyboard, however I didn’t have one around as I decided to start writing this down, but that hardly matters. I’m merely trying to prove I’m not making fake “on paper” claims, rather that it is currently true, even though as you’re reading this, no paper is involved whatsoever). But look at me – here I am, trying to be as smart as a writer, when in fact, I’m not a writer at all, I’m just a human being, who happens to be writing. But where was I? Oh right, when I try to form these thoughts on paper, there’s not much depth or beauty to them at all. I just end up rambling. And all because I’m avoiding writing a beginning, simply because I hate beginnings. Actually, that’s not true at all, I love beginnings, but beginnings of a diary, or of whatever this is, that’s difficult. How do you write the beginning without a back story? How can you understand who I am when you know nothing about me? I guess none of that really matters. I’m really only here to tell you I know nothing.... (read the rest on lisadengler.com);;;;1688;9

Like I never ever understood Italian food or why anyone would choose it over French cuisine or Indian food or pretty much any other type of food in existence. That all changed after my road trip through northern Italy. Not only have I taught myself how to make homemade pasta and pasta sauce, but I am now constantly searching for the best fresh pasta in LA. My current go-to is @centopastabar. It’s a pop up shop that runs out of a wine bar and is only open Wednesday-Saturday 11:00am-3:00pm. There is no set menu, just a burrata starter and 3 fresh pastas that change daily. It’s as close to authentic Italian food as I have found in LA. Totally worth wading through the garbage of DTLA just to eat this deliciousness. P.S. I still don’t like pizza. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Scroll through to see one of my recent meals there.;;centopastabar;;1231;43

3. Invest in a better tripod.

The feeling that everything is changing while at the same time staying exactly the same? After a decade of sharing my life with the you, I have spent the last couple of years hiding behind a veil in a vain effort to maintain my misguided “influencer illusion“. Hiding behind my pretty pictures is a form of self-preservation that helps me cope with feelings of inadequacy and failure. It’s much easier to talk about the feeling of burn out than it is to admit the financial repercussion that come as a result of it. Who wants to talk about downsizing your home, or having to postpone your vacation when you can post a pretty picture while vaguely referencing a feeling almost everyone can relate to. It’s a safe way to share a small slice of reality without ever truly discussing anything real or meaningful. 
My priorities have changed drastically in the last few years. It’s time my content began reflecting that change. The picture I chose to share today is my little reading corner. Why? Because I love the late afternoon light that streams through my windows. I love the view of the entire city sprawled out in front of me (even if the freeway is just below). I love that this is the spot where I found the master's degree program I am applying to. I love that this is the spot where I taught myself how to knit. I love that this is the spot where I vacuum 3 times a day because my 3 dogs shed constantly and it drives me nuts. Most of all I love that this is the spot where I learned that I did not need to travel to discover the wonders of our world. This is the spot that that means nothing to you, but everything to me.";;;;1244;58

Part of my brain screams at me to get up and move. The other part screams at me that none of this is worthwhile. Who else understands what I am talking about when I say “burn out”? I know you’re out there! EDIT : I guess the big question I am asking myself is “What value am I adding by doing what I am doing? And is there something else that I should be putting my time and passion towards?”;;;;824;78

I can’t help but have mixed feelings. On the one hand, hiding likes and other such metrics of influence is a step in the right direction towards curbing the rampant rise of validation culture as well as potentially mitigating the psychological drawbacks associated with the use of social media. But does the hiding of likes/followers/views truly release us from the pressure of this numbers game? Or is this Instagram’s way of hindering the growth of the influencer economy which is getting a large part of the ad spend from companies that would otherwise be advertising through Instagram and Facebook in more traditional ways? Maybe it’s a little bit of both? 🤷🏼‍♀️;;;;1763;67

I started my blog 10 years ago. A long lost time before YouTube stars and Instagram were a thing and receiving a gifting package from American Apparel was a sign that you’ve “made it”. I started my blog while in my last year of college as a creative outlet at a time when my whole world revolved around preparing for grad school. Rather quickly I discovered that my blog offered me an opportunity at something impossible within the world of academia. My blog gave me the opportunity to create my own reality, a way of seeing the world that was all my own. This was and still is the intent with my instagram and with the content I create. I want to share with you my perception of reality, and yes it’s filled with pretty dresses, heart shaped clouds and flower crowns, but it’s also filled with 2:00am donut runs, a deep love of heavy metal, and a lot of dog hair.

I lot of the pieces I own/buy are either too delicate or too precious to be worn. I have no reason to own them aside from the simple fact that just looking at the delicate pieces hanging in my closet brings me joy 🤷🏼‍♀️ @thefineartofdesign;;thefineartofdesign;;1097;34

Was anything missing in your life? Isn’t it liberating living your life without the aching need to document everything you’re doing? Or even worse scrolling through your feed feeling like you’ll never be enough? Can I just say that I’m sharing this photo because I love my polka dot dress and I think I look cute? Can we all agree that behind these picture perfect smiles are vulnerable, delicate, and beautiful human beings? 🙆🏼‍♀️;;;;1690;65

My new pieces from the @splendidla x @graymalin collaboration are the perfect mix of California cozy and coastal chic that can accommodate any golden state excursion I can dream up. From the perfect chambray button down to ultra soft tees printed with iconic Gray Malin artwork, the collection perfectly encapsulates California beachwear. It will easily take you from your morning stroll around the Venice canals to a spontaneous girls night at a concert on the Pier.  Shop the collection at splendid.com.

1. Moved to a new apartment with a gorgeous view.
2. Attended a 3 day silent meditation retreat in Malibu. Something totally new to me, but I ended up enjoying it immensely. I’m currently looking for similar retreats around the country/world. Would love suggestions.
3. Started attending couples counseling with Sam. Because after 13 years every marriage needs some TLC and there’s no shame in that. ❤️

We launched our fourth @summerfridays product #ccmeserum. Went to New York fashion week. Saw our ads in real life. Went back to LA, had a booth at Sephoria. Went back to NYC. Then to Toronto to have a q&a and meet up! Then to NYC again to have a press day and launch my denim collaboration with @dl1961 #mhxdl1961. Made it back to LA for an in store event at @nordstrom for the collab. Shot a campaign with @slipsilkpillowcase with @jenatkinhair. Hosted an influencer lunch for our new product launch. Got a sinus infection and ear infection (that was so awful) Had a pop-up for a weekend at @moonjuice on melrose place. Had a @summerfridays community happy hour. Went back to New York for the third time in a month to celebrate the denim collab at @bloomingdales. And ended the month with a team lunch for all our employees to celebrate all of their hard work. (and I’m sure I’m forgetting some things 🤷🏻‍♀️) In between these major moments I tried to see my friends, call my parents, work out and settle into my new home. All while juggling a never ending email inbox, meetings, calls and just life in general. September made me feel grateful for the opportunities my career and business have given me, thankful for my health (and knowing the importance of taking care of myself) and proud of myself for getting through an intense month. Now I’m ready for a more chill October 😂;ccmeserum,mhxdl1961;summerfridays,dl1961,nordstrom,slipsilkpillowcase,jenatkinhair,moonjuice,summerfridays,bloomingdales;;4962;76

I didn’t love the idea of sharing it but then I thought, I worked hard for this why should I feel bad? I loved my body before. I love it now. It’s just stronger and (I hope) healthier. In 2017 I made my 2018 vision board and wanted a healthier lifestyle. I didn’t really stick with it but would go in spurts. But when I made my 2019 vision board I didn’t want a “diet” I wanted to have an overall healthier lifestyle of nourishing my body with better food choices, working out consistently and making it a part of my life - not just a special occasion thing. It’s pretty hard with my schedule - but this year was no excuses.
Here’s what I did ...
• I treated my workouts like any other appointments or meetings I had and blocked out time in my calendar for them
• I scheduled workouts that would have cancellation fees or penalties so I wouldn’t want to flake last minute on them
• I kept track of my progress from January to now so I could see small changes
• when I’m in LA I do reformer pilates 2-4x a week on with @pilates_by_amanda
• when I travel or go to the gym I do @kelseywells PWR workout on @sweat app
• I only added cardio in about two months ago but rarely do it
• I follow @bewellbykelly nutrition plan that isn’t a diet but a way of eating for a healthier lifestyle
• I still skip workouts or feel unmotivated, i don’t restrict food or feel guilty when I want to indulge in something and I still love my 🍫 and 🍷 but now I feel more balanced with my choices
• I’m proud of myself because this is the longest in my life that I’ve consistently ate well and worked out and I hope this inspires you to stick to something you’ve been wanting to do that makes you feel happy and confident ❤️
ps don’t ask how much I weigh because I’m not sharing this to be comparing numbers on a scale.";;pilates,kelseywells,sweat,bewellbykelly;;34180;752

I dedicated my speech to all of you so here it is, hope this inspires some of you. ❤️—I prepared a little something just in case I won, because what I learned about my last speeches is that I’m not good at giving spontaneous ones.
First of I want to thank the @dailyfrontrow and @revolve for this award and for nominating me.
Since this is a people’s choice award, I want to dedicate this speech to everyone who voted and to everybody who’s in any doubt on making decisions about their future.
While I was writing my marketing thesis on the ease of retrieval effect in 2012 my professor came up to me one day and showed me the speech that Steve Jobs gave at the Stanford University in 2005.
Not knowing at the time that this speech was going to change every important decision I was going to be making about my future.
I was really scared at the beginning to;
- put myself out there on social media and sharing so much of myself,
- for my partner to quit his job while we were living on one salary,
- to invest all our savings to start our own hair-care brand; Gisou
I bet I wouldn’t stand here today if it wasn’t for that speech.
So, that is why I want to read a short part of it.
“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”
Also, a big congratulations to @mmente on winning fashion visionary. I’ve known you for 5 years and there really isn’t anybody I know that deserves this award more than you.
Also, a big thank you to the entire Revolve team and especially @raissagerona for believing, growing and shaping the influencer industry.";;dailyfrontrow,revolve,mmente,raissagerona;;199757;1620

Honestly I love that these kind of looks are both of our favourite. We are sort of the same now but we’re still very different in other ways. And I love how there’s never been moments where we didn’t know what to say to each other. Love how we still talk endlessly and have to force ourselves to go to bed while we rather stay up all night and talk. Everything we do together is exciting and I will never get tired of dressing the same way, working together, our endless conversations, of playing games (backgammon) and of loving one another.;;;;243787;1014

When my brother passed I found it extremely difficult to sleep at night. I still have panic attacks and anxiety even three years later. That’s why I initially took the dive and adopted Finn. He’s my first dog ever! I was issued an ESA (Emotional support animal) letter by my therapist to allow Finn to fly with me as a comfort animal. I’ve had anxiety with flying for pretty much all of my adult life. I definitely recommend an animal for those of you that suffer from anxiety.

The first thing I do is consider taking a day or two off from creating. It’s okay to give yourself space and try to do some self care, personally I like hitting the gym and cooking delicious healthy meals. Pushing yourself too hard when the time just isn’t right normally doesn’t work out. After a break I like to dive into Pinterest and start making mood boards. This helps me feel inspired almost instantly! Then I like to get out there and start shooting, or drawing... whichever form it may be. Maintaining a positive mindset once you get back to creating is so important. I try to have a “I will make great art today” attitude. Lmk if you have any additional tips in the comments! I’d love to hear what you guys do ❤️;;;;6446;78

I’m finally revealing a room in our apartment that I don’t think I’ve ever shared on my feed, our guest bedroom! We fully did this room about 6 months ago and I shared that to my YouTube, just to completely take everything down, repaint and do it all over again. Not everything is as perfect as it seems here on social media! Our apartment sadly doesn’t get a TON of natural light, it’s the one downfall. However a coat of lighter paint and some whimsical airy decor on light wood shelving definitely gave this room a HUGE upgrade. I feel so fancy having my coffee back here now! And I did this room so affordably, which I know is so important to so many of you, and to myself as well!

I had a laser genesis facial and omg... my skin feels so fresh and bright! It’s so much better and different than a regular spa facial. If you’re in New York I highly recommend them for any of your dermatologist needs. Have you ever had a treatment or facial like this before?;;dermduo;;7213;135

I carry a lot of emotions for my brother who passed away two years ago. My brother was gay and struggled quite a bit coming out to myself and my family. I’ll never forget the day I found out and how happy I was for him, that he could just be himself finally and feel free to be exactly the person he wanted to be, and love whoever he loved. I remember going to my first pride celebration with him, it was so much fun! It pains me that my brother ever had an ounce of insecurity, about his sexuality or anything else. He was simply amazing. I wrote him a letter in the mail exclaiming how thrilled I was for him, and how I would always love him no matter what. I still love you, Chris. No matter what. I miss you every day, and pride always makes me feel like you’re all around me. 🌈  #Pride2019;pride2019;;;21479;207

.
Although I occasionally get 2-3 headache and migraine days per month, it's astounding to know that 3.3M Americans experience 15 or more headache days a month, 8 of which are associated with migraine (defined as Chronic Migraine). When I get migraines, I experience severe pain in my head, sensitivity to light, fatigue, and dizziness. I’ve missed countless dinner parties, events, and even my own birthday one year! I cringe when I think of the days when I didn’t feel my absolute best. Though I have not been diagnosed with Chronic Migraine and am not currently being treated with BOTOX®, those living with Chronic Migraine shouldtalk to their doctor and consider this treatment option to prevent headaches and migraines before they start. BOTOX®prevents on average 8 to 9 headache days and migraine/probable migraine days a month (vs 6 to 7 for placebo). Talk to your doctor and find out more at (http://bit.ly/2TdnJ0Y) #ChronicMigraine
.
BOTOX®  is for adults with Chronic Migraine, 15 or more headache days a month, lasting 4 hours or more. It is not approved for adults with migraine who have 14 or fewer headache days a month. 
Important Safety Information
Effects of BOTOX® may spread hours to weeks after injection causing serious symptoms. Alert your doctor right away, as difficulty swallowing, speaking, breathing, eye problems, or muscle weakness can be signs of a life-threatening condition. Patients with these conditions before injection are at highest risk. Side effects may include allergic reactions, neck and injection site pain, fatigue, and headache. Allergic reactions can include rash, welts, asthma symptoms, and dizziness. Don’t receive BOTOX®if there’s a skin infection. Tell your doctor your medical history, muscle or nerve conditions (including ALS/Lou Gehrig’s disease, myasthenia gravis, or Lambert-Eaton syndrome), and medications, including botulinum toxins, as these may increase the risk of serious side effects. Talk to your doctor and visit https://bit.ly/1Pvz8Cc.

I attribute a lot of my pregnancy, birth, and recovery period so far to maintaining healthy habits throughout. One of these habits was daily intake of collagen - my favorite being @shoremagic. 
I got to sit down with the founder of @shoremagic, who is a wealth of information, to find out what it is exactly about collagen that helps with so many purposes- from healing, to mental health, to the pursuit of youthfulness (hint - this one goes way beyond skin deep). Check www.thoughtfulmisfit.com to read about the real benefits of collagen and why it works so well for so many things. ⚡️⭐️";;shoremagic,shoremagic;;724;23

The 'N' is for Nikko - my husband, my best friend, and the center of my world. I've always been a bit of a realist, but with @NikkoValentino, it really was love at first sight. The moment he spoke, I knew he was the one - and that the little voice in my head that was telling me to dive in head-first was right. 6 months later, we eloped and have been inseparable ever since. Over the last 12 and a half years, we've supported each other through everything - every risk, every victory, every hardship. He makes me feel seen and safe and free. And I admire him so much for his integrity, capacity to love, vulnerability, and strength. But now, the 'N' on this necklace is going to stand for two loves of my life! In the next few weeks, we will be welcoming our little baby ""N"" into this world! Wearing this necklace makes my heart burst with happiness! I'm so grateful for how much love I have been lucky enough to receive in this life and can't wait for what lies ahead!

There’s a reason why @drunkelephant is a preferred brand over here at Thoughtful Misfit. And there’s a reason why their #thelittles kit (available at Sephora inside @JCPenney) is small but so powerful. #drunkelephant is committed to using only ingredients that directly benefit the skin’s health or support the integrity and effectiveness of their formulations.
The Littles Kit consists of everything you need to cleanse that skincare palette of any hidden ingredients that might be affecting your skin negatively. That means no drying alcohols, silicones, chemical screens, fragrance, dyes, or SLS - the six ingredients @DrunkElephant believes are at the root of almost every skin issue. Because sometimes what you don’t know (is in your skincare) CAN hurt you.

But one ultrasound later and to our relief, he is not only perfectly healthy, but he’s actually a week ahead growth wise! It’s fascinating how differently people’s pregnancies can be. Feeling all kinds of relieved and also pretty proud of my little predator (the nickname I gave him once he started kicking... this boy is active). In other news, I have now had three dreams about giving birth to my dog... and she always comes out talking like a little old man... what is UP with these dreams? 😂 (dress is from @idsfashions via @forbloggersonly) #29weeks;babybump,tikkotot,29weeks;idsfashions,forbloggersonly;;931;78

Up till now, I really haven’t slowed down that much and it has been such a gift (I am thankful every day, knowing that this won’t last forever!). I also think staying active has helped me hold onto my sense of identity - knowing that while there have been huge changes in our lives, and there are lots more to come, I don’t have to change who I inherently am as a person. However! I DO book a bike as close to the door as possible at @soulcycle now, because tapping it back reaaallly makes me have to pee... 😂😂😂 🚽 🏃🏻‍♀️ 🚲 #soulgifted #28weeks #thirdtrimester #wearyoursoul;soulgifted,28weeks,thirdtrimester,wearyoursoul;soulcycle;;838;33

What if this weekend, we all set aside just a little time to brainstorm on actualized steps we could take to work towards them this coming week? 
These steps don't need to be big. In fact, it's often better if they are small and careful - after all, it's the consistency of small, careful steps that lead us to great strides.

So while you're spending this weekend resting and regrouping for the week ahead, ask yourself - what's one small step that you can take during this coming week to be closer to reaching your goals?

For everything in life there is a solution. We are humans, sometimes we complain with reason, but often we catch ourselves complaining about stupid stuff, and that’s when you have to stop, and reflect about all the blessings in your life. No matter what you are going thru, life will always, always give you a reason to smile!)

It’s about feeling confident and fulfilled in all parts of your life to where you feel comfortable and secure in your own skin. That confidence comes to everyone in different ways, my self esteem is the highest when I am working hard and feeling fulfilled, when I know I am looking after my body how I should and when I know I am being a loving, positive person to the people around me. It’s not just about “embracing the body god gave you”, being confident in a bikini is so much more than that. So if you’re wondering why you don’t feel great in the bikini, look deeper into why you feel that way and work from the inside out. 🙌🏼💫🙏🏻;;;mondayswimwear;35873;259

Just so you guys know it really is all about the angle and light. 💁🏼‍♀️I’ve been modeling swimwear for almost 12 years now and everyone’s body can look amazing in some light and from some angles and horrible in others! A lot of people ask me my main tips for taking bikini pics and they are to always elongate your body, point your toes, keep your arms off the sides of your body but most importantly to just smile and relax! Think of how the 80’s and 90’s supermodels would do it before editing! I think everyone should embrace their natural beauty but I also know how discouraging it can feel to see a photo of yourself where you don’t feel your best, so I get it ladies, the camera can be your best friend and worst enemy 🤦🏼‍♀️!!! Either way keep rocking those bikini bodies and don’t forget everybody has a “bikini body”!!!✨ wearing #mondaysignaturecollection;mondaysignaturecollection;;;26745;293
